PONTIAC INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Sherman, Andrew
 
 
 
History of Present Illness:  The patient returns one week after being 
seen here initially in Internal Medicine clinic.  On the last visit he was having 
chest pain and was therefore sent to the Emergency Room for a further 
evaluation.  At that time he had EKGs which did not demonstrate any 
ischemia during his chest pain and a chest x-ray which was unremarkable.  
The Emergency Room physicians contacted his doctors at Humbert Hospital and obtained a history that the patient had a cardiomyopathy in 
the past with a decreased LV function.  However repeat echo within the 
past months demonstrated good LV function and they were in the process 
of performing further cardiac testing when the patient left the 
Humbert Hospital against medical advice.  After being evaluated in the 
Emergency Room at Pontiac State, he now returns to be tied in with 
the Internal Medicine clinic.  
 
Medications:  His medications since his Emergency Room visit include 
Carafate 1 gm. PO q.i.d., Prinivil 10 mg. PO q.d., Tenormin 50 mg. PO 
q.d., Motrin 600 mg. t.i.d. p.r.n. and Nitrostat tablets p.r.n.  His 
insulin dosing consists of 40 units of NPH q.a.m. and 18 units q.p.m. 
and regular insulin 20 units q.a.m.  
 
On return to my office today, he states that the frequency of his chest 
pain is much diminished but that he has gained some weight since 
discontinuing his Lasix per order of the Emergency Room physicians.
 
Physical Exam:  On exam, his blood pressure is 160/100 with a heart rate 
of 76.  He is not in any acute distress.  His chest is clear to 
auscultation.  His cardiac exam demonstrates S4 gallop and distant heart 
sounds.  His abdominal exam is benign except for massive obesity.  His 
rectal exam is guaiac negative.  His extremities exam demonstrates 1+ 
pitting edema to the shins and his neurologic exam is unremarkable.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Cardiac.  The patient will be scheduled for an ETT thallium study 
     to rule out ischemia.
 
2.   Hypertension.  His Prinivil will be increased to 20 mg. q.d.
 
3.   Diabetes.  His sugars have been running 130 to 160 by fingerstick 
     checks at home and he will continue his present regimen.
 
4.   The patient will be referred to ophthalmology for the evaluation of 
     his eyes given his history of hypertension and diabetes.
 
5.   General.  The patient will see me shortly after completion of an 
     ETT thallium study for further discussion of his cardiac status.
