A/P:

1) URI like sx with pharyngitis and some sinus pressure. will get throat cx to r/o strep throat. will also give a course of zithromax 500 x1 then 250 qd for 4 days. pt to call in AM to get results of throat cx. will give cepacol OTC for sore throat relief and afrin spray for nasal congetsion.

2) SOB/CVS symptoms I advised the patient that he needs to go to the EW now to be evaluated for his cardiac symptoms and explained to him that his diabetes, his Hx of CAD/CABG and the recurrence of his sx  puts him at a significant high risk . I offered to send him by ambulance from here, he did not want to go to EW, did not want an ECG stating that he will see his cardiologist next week. he clearly understands the risks and benefits including the risk of death if he does not go to EW today.

3) increased BP, he said he is compliant with his meds,he agreed to come back in Am for recheck.
