She is s/p L SFA and doing well from that standopoint, however developed N&V today and required NG tube placement, now better but remaoins NPO.

Assessment

Type 2 DM - uncontrolled in the post operative period requring IV insulin for control. Complicated by PVD, neuropathy, retinopathy and nephropathy.



Glycemic control in the post operative period is essential to good wound healing and minimizing risk of infections. Our target is to maintain BG under 150.



Recommendation

- While NPO please use 1/2 day time NPH but her usual prescribed bed time dose - for now 15 nph in am and 8 at hs

- Once eating can resume usual doses, may need addition of rapid action insulin with meals as well



Thank you, please page Internal Medicine # 42721 with any questions.
