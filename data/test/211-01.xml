CCU JAR Admission Note



Name: Urban, Russell

MRN:  4722064

Date of Admission:  7/09/93

PCP:   Georgia

Cards: ward



ID:  50 y/o man transferred to CCU for wide complex tachyarrhythmia 



HPI:  50 y/o man with no PMH and cardiac risk factors of smoking and family history (father died of MI at age 41) who presented to the ED with chest pain. He had an ETT per patient report in Georgia which was neg for ischemia 4 years ago.  He claims excellent exercise tolerance can run at least 3 miles without SOB or CP but does not exercise regularly.   At concert on day of admission, he was sitting at rest when he had sudden onset of crushing sub-sternal chest pain, 8/10, no radiation, associated with mild SOB and marked diaphoresis.  Pt reported some associated back pain with onset, like "I was being crushed like a sandwich."  Was not eating at time, not like heartburn, no fevers, chills, cough, or chest trauma.  EMT was called-2 SL ntg relieved pain, was given ASA. 



On arrival to the ED, he was chest pain free.  His HR was 52-60 in normal sinus rhythm.  On hindsight, EKG showed sinus bradycardia with 1mm STE in III,    mm aVF, 1mm STD in I, ? aVL with biphasic T in I, TWI in aVL.  He received ASA and SLTNG

Cardiac RF include tobacco (1/2 ppd x 30 yrs) and early family hx (Dad died of MI, first MI at 41).  No known HTN, DM, or hyperlipidemia.  



Course on floor:



Seen for initial H&P when patient came to CCU5.  During exam, patient became acutely diaphoretic, appeared uncomfortable, still complaining of CP with some mild back pain.  

BP:  L arm 105/66, R arm 90/63. (2 rpt BPs were equal on both arms within 5 mm Hg) HR bradycardia in high 40s, sat 98% 2L.  Tele demonstrated sinus brady, then several runs of 40-50bt wide QRS tachyarrythmia which spontaneously resolved back to sinus bradycardia. Pt was symptomatic during these episodes and appeared acutely SOB, diaphoretic.  Nursing supervisor and medical senior stat paged, 12 ld EKG repeated, pt was given 2 mg IV magnesium and 100mg of lidocaine, started on nonbreather. Heparin was ordered and pt was transferred to the CCU.  



On arrival to CCU, pt was lethargic and diaphoretic.  He denied chest pain, shortness of breath, nausea.



SDU Course:

For ventricular ectopy (likely AIVR in setting of ischemia), pt was transitioned to Amiodarone.  This was tapered off and he had no further ectopy.

 

Echo was performed 7/10:

                                  (normal)     (completed only if abn.)

PERICARDIUM       NORM



MITRAL VALVE

There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse.  There is trace mitral

regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler.



LEFT ATRIUM

There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation.



AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT

There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis.  The aortic valve is

tricuspid.  There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral

Doppler.



LEFT VENTRICLE

The left ventricular cavity size is normal.  The left ventricular systolic

function is impaired.  The left ventricle is diffusely hypokinetic with

regional variation. The Inferior wall is akinetic.  The estimated ejection

fraction is 28 %.



TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC

There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of trace tricuspid insufficiency.



RIGHT VENTRICLE

The right ventricle is not dilated.  The right ventricle is diffusely

hypokinetic.



PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES

There is no evidence of pericardial effusion.



Pt was taken to the cath lab 7/11 where his RHC showed RA 9, PA 25/15/20, PCWP 13, CO 6.4.  Mild LAD disease, 30% circumflex stenosis, RCA 100% occlusion, stented x3 with dissection of RCA during procedure.  He also had transient reocclusion during procedure.  TIMI II flow after IC adenosine.  IABP and temp wire (for profound bradycardia) were placed during procedure.  V-gram showed basal inferior AK and anterolateral HK, EF approximately 40%.  His peak CK were 1491.

Because his initial echo showed low EF out of proportion to his ischemic event, other causes of low EF were investigated.  His serum Fe was slightly low, TSH was normal, SPEP had several low Igs but no evidence of myeloma.   Lipid profile showed Cholesterol 210, Trig 59, HDL 45, LDL 153.  HgbA1c was 6.3.  Because of reocclusion during cath, hypercoag workup was sent and was negative (including lupus anticoagulant, hypercoag panel, HIT).

He continued to have some chest pain post-cath with mild increase of CK likely d/t distal embolization.  He has now been persistently pain-free.  His IABP was d/ced 7/12.  He was continued on ASA, Plavix, Lipitor and Bblocker, Captopril were added and can be titrated up.

Imp:  50 y/o man with CRFs smoking and family history s/p RCA stent x3, s/p IABP now titrating up meds.



Plan

1.	Ischemia - 

  	ASA, Plavix, B-Blocker, Captopril, titrate up as tolerated.



2.	Pump - EF improved on LV gram at cath.  Diurese prn, plan echo in 2-3 months to assess recovery.  If persistent low EF, may need further w/u for additional causes of cardiomyopathy.



3.	Rhythm -  no ectopy, now off Amiodarone.  Replete K, Mg.



4.  Prophylaxis: Fragmin, Nexium
