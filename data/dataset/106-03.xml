NAME:    Justus, Quiana

MRN:     9814048



The patient comes in today for follow up of several medical problems. She has a

history of type 2 diabetes. Her sugars have not been optimally controlled. They are

usually in the 190-200 range in the morning. Her weight is stable. She has no lower

extremity numbness or weakness.  



She has a history of hyperlipidemia. She stopped her Lescol 2 weeks ago because it

was expensive. She also never increased the dose above 20 mg. She has had side

effects with atorvastatin and pravastatin in the past. Please see her allergy list in

LMR.



She has a half sister who had colon cancer at age 88. Quiana has had rare

occasional blood streaking when she wipes herself after being constipated. She is

aware of what a colonoscopy is but absolutely refuses a colonoscopy. She is aware

that she is at increased risk for colon cancer given her family history. She has no

nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, melena or weight loss.



She has chronic lower back pain and bilateral leg pain that is probably due to spinal

stenosis. She has lower back pain and pain in her legs that is worse with walking. It

helps when she uses a carriage to walk around in the store. She denies lower

extremity numbness, change in her bowel or bladder, fevers or chills. Her last MRI

was done in Walsenburg in a wide body machine and was consistent with spinal stenosis. 

She has taken Ultram. She is aware that Vioxx may increase people's risk for cardiac

disease and has stopped taking it. Dr. Yeager, her rheumatologist, referred her to Dr.

North in Internal Medicine for possible injections. 



PHYSICAL EXAM: No acute distress. Her blood pressure is 180/90. However, her

daughter,Iyanna Field, checks her blood pressure at home and it is very well controlled. 

The patient gets very anxious here in the clinic. Neck supple without JVD or bruits.

Lungs clear without wheezes, rales or rhonchi. Cardiac: Rate regularly regular,

normal S1, S2 without S3, S4 or murmurs. No C/C/E. Distal pulses intact.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Type 2 diabetes. Check hemoglobin A1c. Continue current medications.



(2)  Hyperlipidemia. She should be on medication to keep her LDL below 100. She

     said that she would resume the medication.



(3)  Hypertension which is never well controlled on her visits here. Her daughter is

     a nursing professional and does report that her blood pressure is very well controlled

     in the 120/80 range when she checks at home. We will continue her current

     regimen.



(4)  Lower back pain. Probably secondary to spinal stenosis. She has an

     appointment with Dr. North.
