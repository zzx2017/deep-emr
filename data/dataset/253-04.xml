10/07/74                            NEGATIVE          





	



	Assessment and plan:

   He has presented with very atypical chest pain with negative markers and unchanged ECG. Thjis is chest wall pain - not cardiac. It is clearly - in pt's view and mine - different from the pain of his CAD. He is OK to go home with dx of chest wall pain. OK to use Ibuprofen prn - should be ok in low dose on full stomach despite his h/o dyspepsia. F/u w Dr Cook.
