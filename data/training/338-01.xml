                                              12-21-88
 
 
 
Patient is a 34-year-old man who comes in for follow up on his newly 
diagnosed type II diabetes.  He has been very compliant with his 
medication regimen which consists of metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and NPH 
insulin subQ q.AM.  He has had 2 episodes of sweating, but he did not 
check his blood sugar at the time.  He has not had any frank 
palpitations or lightheadedness.  He did have 1 episode where he had the 
sensation of several extra heart beats.  This was not accompanied by 
other symptoms including no chest pain.  He has never had a fingerstick 
blood glucose below the mid 150's.  I am looking through his log and see 
that his AM prebreakfast glucoses have been between 178-306 and before 
dinner they have been between 157-296.  He has already met several times 
with Makenzie Kim for diabetes education and for tailoring of his 
therapy and has met with a nutritionist to review the concepts of a 
diabetic diet.  
 
On physical exam, he is in no distress, his weight is 231, his blood 
pressure is 132/78 in the right arm sitting.
 
IMPRESSION AND PLAN: He still has high sugars. I will increase his 
insulin regimen.  He is amenable to adding a second injection and so his 
new regimen will be NPH insulin 15 units before breakfast and 15 units 
before bedtime.  And he continues to take metformin 850mg PO t.i.d. and 
I have given him a prescription for this, #90, refills 3, as well as 
syringes and needles, #60, refills 3.  He is to follow up with me in 
several months and sooner if he has new problems or concerns.  I have 
advised him about increasing his level of activity and about maintaining 
his diet and I have also asked him to contact me if he should have any 
symptoms of hypoglycemia and to obtain his fingerstick glucose reading 
at that time as well.
