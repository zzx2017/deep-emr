      Team A Intern Admit Note

Patient Name: Tammy Umphrey

MR#  0942207

Date of Admission:  8/26/66

Attending: Yoel Pollard

PCP:  Susan Ullom



CC/ID:  70 yo woman with significant disability following cerebral aneurysm rupture 1/ 66, admitted with likely UTI and question of altered mental status



HPI:  (As summarized from ED admit note and computer notes, pt is not able to give history and family is not present.)  Ms. Umphrey is somewhat cognitively and expressively impaired following rupture of a cerebral aneurysm 1/ 66; she was required sub-occipital craniotomy, clot evacuation, and placement for a VP shunt.  She was transferred to Kingsley County Clinic 2/66, and was d/c'd 5/31/66. Discharge summary indicates that her baseline at that time included being able to follow 1 step commands part of the time and some attempts at communication.  She gets nutrition and medication through a G-tube at this point, and has had an indwelling foley catheter.

	Computer notes suggest that prior to August 5, the indwelling foley catheter had been removed. However, the patient's constant incontinence and difficulty keeping a decubitus ulcer dry, the notes suggest that the foley was replaced 8/5/66.  8/09/66 Ms. Umphrey was taken to the emergency room; the symptoms she was having at that time are not clear. U/A was suggestive of a UTI, and she was treated with a 3-day course of levofloxacin. There is no record of her foley catheter being changed at that time, and urine cultures were not sent.  Telephone notes from 8/23 suggest that Ms. Umphrey had yeast infection and foley blockage;  8/25 the VNA checked a U/A at home; results were consistent with a UTI.  Her husband reports that she has also been more somnolent and    less herself    over the last few days. She was sent to the PDI ED for further evaluation.

	In the ED, repeat U/A was consistent with UTI; urine culture grew abundant staph aureus. She was given a dose of levofloxacin 500mg and transferred to the floor.

Microbiology:





CXR:	The findings are consistent with pulmonary venous hypertension with possible early interstitial edema.



Head CT:  1. No significant change compared to prior CT Brain-04/18/2066.

	No change in ventricle size.   No acute infarct; although, this is

	better assessed with MR with diffusion.

	2.  Patchy low attenuation areas in the centrum semiovale

	bilaterally which are more prominent now and most likely are due

	to chronic microangiopathic changes in this agroup.



EKG:	Normal sinus rhythm, normal axis, normal intervals. Flattened T-waves, but not changed from prior exam. No evidence of acute ischemia.



Impression:  70 yo woman with compromised baseline neurologic function, admitted with complicated UTI and possible change in mental status.



Mental status changes: given likely undertreated UTI 8/09/66, pt likely has recurrent complicated UTI and may have some mental status alterations from this source. Important to rule out VP-shunt complication as cause of mental status chage, but CT appears unchanged from 4/66. Hyponatremia may also be contributing somewhat  to mental status changes.

-will treat UTI and pursue possibility of urosepsis with blood cultures

-will check TSH and am cortisol which could also contribute to mental status changes, particularly given pts history of hypothyroidism

UTI

-likely UTI- tx

-will send blood cultures to assess for sepsis from urinary source

-unclear if staph aureus is true urinary pathogen, but will treat with vancomycin until sensitivities come back, then treat with appropriate antibiotic

-treat with levoquin for complicated UTI while awaiting final microbiology data

-change foley now

-resend u/a and culture after 1-2 days of antibiotics

Hyponatremia- may be contributing to any change in mental status

-volume status very difficult to assess- if hypovolemic, likely hypovolemic hyponatremia. If euvolemic, likely SIADH, which could be caused by neurologic process, pain, or infection

-given difficulty assessing volume status, will send urine for sodium and osm. If low sodium high osm, likely hypovolemic. If higher sodium, more likely SIADH.

DM

-will switch patient to ISS for now to assess in-hospital insulin requirements

Hypothyroidism- continue levothyroxine at home dose, checking TSH

GI/FEN- ranitidine BID, glucerna tube feeds per KCC discharge summary

HTN-continue home medications

wound care consult requested for report of decubitus ulcer
