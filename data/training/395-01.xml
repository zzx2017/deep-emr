DO,TANYA V   639-25-21-7                    VISIT DATE: 11/10/04

The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation were 

reviewed by me; and I concur.  In addition, I personally 

interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 76-year-old female with 

a history of type 2 diabetes on Glucophage with a history of 

neuropathy who presents complaining of right foot pain, swelling, 

and redness.  The patient had a callus shaved off the plantar 

aspect of her foot approximately three weeks ago.  She noticed some 

aching pain in the area of her foot over the last several days and 

then in the last 24 to 48 hours has developed swelling and redness 

of her foot with inability to ambulate secondary to severe pain.  

She has had loss of appetite, but she denies any fever or 

generalized malaise.  She denies any leg swelling.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for arthritis, type 2 diabetes, a 

history of vasculitis, history of diabetic neuropathy, and history 

of cataracts.  Her surgical history is positive for right total hip 

replacement, bilateral knee replacements, laminectomy in the back 

with fusion with rods, and a history of a colostomy with reversal.  

SOCIAL HISTORY AND FAMILY HISTORY:  She has smoked in the past.  

She does not drink.  She is a retired Paralegal, lives alone.  She 

has a family history of diabetes.  Please see resident note for the 

remainder of the details of the patient's history including a long 

list of medications.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 99.0, pulse 94, 

respirations 18, blood pressure 137/50.  Oxygen saturation is 92% 

on room air.  The patient is an awake, alert, well-developed 

female, pleasant, talkative, in no acute distress.  EXTREMITIES: 

Her examination is most remarkable for the right lower extremity 

which shows edema and redness over the dorsum of her right foot.  

This extends down over the metatarsophalangeal joints and down 

underneath the plantar aspect of her foot over the heads of the 

metatarsals and the bases of the toes.  On the plantar aspect of 

the foot below the third toe, there is an area of skin change which 

is very tender.  There is a blanching yellow appearance that is 

very firm.  It is not fluctuant.  There is no drainage.  It appears 

to be the area where the callus was shaved.  The remainder of the 

foot is slightly firm, erythematous, and tender.  Her pulses are 

1+.  She has good capillary refill, and light touch is intact.  Her 

calf is soft and nontender.  Please see the resident note for the 

remainder of the details of the physical examination.  Evaluation 

of this patient in the Emergency Department included laboratory 

studies.  This is a diabetic patient with foot cellulitis secondary 

to a wound on the plantar aspect of her foot.  Of note, she also is 

exposed to pool water as she swims daily.  

LABORATORY EVALUATION:  She had laboratory studies performed which 

show a white blood cell count of 14,000; hematocrit 31.5; platelets 

348.  Her electrolytes including glucose are pending at the time of 

this dictation.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  IV access was obtained, and the 

patient was treated with IV antibiotics of Levaquin and 

Clindamycin.  

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Right foot cellulitis.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Her primary care 

physician, Dr. Keane, who saw her prior to her arrival in the 

Emergency Department was contacted.  The patient is being admitted 

to the General Medical Service.  Please see the resident note for 

the remainder of the details of the patient's visit.
