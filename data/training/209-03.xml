He does have peripheral vascular disease and coronary artery disease as well as diabetes mellitus. We will need to check hemoglobin A1c to determine the level of control. Last hemoglobin A1c was June 2093, and it was 6.8. Continue current management of diabetes mellitus with insulin. Continue to treat and monitor blood pressure. Patient is intolerant of ACE inhibitor due to renal dysfunction. 



Renal dysfunction: He has seen Dr. Krause from Renal associates. He does have bilateral renal artery stenosis. He has also seen Dr. Locklear for consideration of intervention for renal artery stenosis. Patient cannot tolerate an ACE inhibitor.

Shortness of breath: Patient states he has some exertional shortness of breath. He is not short of breath at rest. There is no PND, or orthopnea. There is no edema. Examination of the lungs do not revealing any rales. Assessment is shortness of breath which is likely related bronchitis. 

 He has multiple reasons (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and coronary artery disease)  and deconditioning and that can account for his baseline shortness of breath.

He will follow up with Dr. Paul Krause for following his renal function. Will discuss possible management of renal artery stenosis with Dr. Locklear and Dr. Krause. Given overall comorbidities, would be hesitant to pursue any invasive procedure or surgery that does not have a good chance for success.
