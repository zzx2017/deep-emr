EDVISIT^42521583^ZASTROW, IRENE^11/01/85^CONNER, VICKIE

The resident's history, physical examination, and evaluation

reviewed by me and I concur.  In addition, I personally

interviewed and examined this patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 65-year-old female who

presents for evaluation of chest pain.  The patient had no

history of coronary artery disease until the last week.  She was

apparently in Pennsylvania where she had been for the last week.  She

had been having 5 days of epigastric and substernal discomfort. 

She considered it to be indigestion and have been taking Tums. 

After approximately 5 days while in Pennsylvania, she felt that the

discomfort was not improving.  She did feel like that she had

less energy for her usual activity.  She went to a hospital there

in her land of Pennsylvania where she was noted to have a positive

troponin.  She underwent a diagnostic catheterization that did

show multivessel disease with an occluded LAD.  She subsequently

underwent a therapeutic PCI with stenting of her LAD.  She did

have recurrent chest pain today after catheterization, which was

much more severe, sharper in nature per her description.  She was

told in the hospital in Pennsylvania that this was due to reperfusion.

 She returned home today, called her primary care physician and

was advised to come to the Emergency Department for evaluation. 

She does state that since discharge from the hospital in Pennsylvania

earlier this week, she has had intermittent episodes of more

severe left anterior chest pain, which she describes as somewhat

more sharp than the indigestion feeling she was experiencing

before.  It is not always associated with exertion.  It sometimes

radiates to her left shoulder.  It is not pleuritic in nature. 

It seems to be intermittent, although she does have a low level

of dull aching pain, which has been fairly constant since her

discharge from Pennsylvania.  She denies any shortness of breath.  She

is able to lie flat.  Denies any lower extremity edema.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Positive for type 1 diabetes, which is

fairly brittle per her report.  She is status post MI within the

last week.  She also has a remote history of PE in the past and

is no longer on Coumadin.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She does not smoke.  She lives with her husband

and has recently returned from Pennsylvania.

FAMILY HISTORY:  Reviewed and is also positive for CAD.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  All other systems are reviewed and are also

negative except per the HPI.

MEDICATIONS:  Include insulin, Plavix, aspirin, Nexium, Lipitor,

and atenolol.

ALLERGIES:  The patient has allergies to iodine and Indocin.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her temperature is 98.6, her pulse 65,

respirations 18, and blood pressure 105/69.  The patient is

awake, alert, pleasant female who is reclining in no acute

distress.  Her head examination is normocephalic and atraumatic. 

Her pupils are equal and reactive to light.  Her sclerae are

anicteric.  Her conjunctivae are pink and moist.  She has moist

mucous membranes and appears well hydrated.  Her neck is supple

and nontender with full range of motion.  The JVP is not

elevated.  Her lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally with

equal breath sounds, no respiratory distress.  No accessory

muscle use and no chest wall tenderness.  Her cardiac examination

is regular rate and rhythm with no murmur, rub, or gallop.  Her

abdomen is nondistended, soft, and nontender.  No guarding, no

peritoneal signs, and no organomegaly.  Her skin is intact, warm,

dry, and slightly pale.  There are no rashes.  Her back is

nontender with full range of motion.  Extremities reveal no

cyanosis, clubbing, or edema.  Her calves are soft and nontender

with no palpable cords and full range of motion with normal

strength and tone.  She is alert and oriented x3, very pleasant. 

Cranial nerves are intact, and there is no motor or sensory

deficit.  Rectal examination performed by the resident reveals

heme-negative stool with normal tone.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was placed on a cardiac

monitor.  IV access was maintained.  Laboratory studies were sent

and EKG was also ordered.  Her prior records from Pennsylvania were

reviewed.  Her white blood cell count is 8.4, hematocrit 37, and

platelets 285,000.  Her electrolytes are within normal limits. 

Her BUN is 18, creatinine 0.8, and glucose 112.  Her CK here

returned normal at 33.  Her MB was 0.4.  Her troponin returned

elevated at 0.39.  This is in comparison to the troponin from her

records of Pennsylvania, which was 0.2.  Her d-dimer is less than 200.

 Her INR is 1.1.  The patient had an EKG, which showed evidence

of a new T-wave inversions, present on prior EKG from this

hospital.  She was started on heparin for concern of unstable

angina status post MI, remained hemodynamically stable, and is

admitted to the Cardiac Service.

DIAGNOSIS:  Chest pain, rule out unstable angina.
