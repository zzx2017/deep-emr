EDVISIT^43471375^KIMBROUGH, AMELIA^04/08/59^PHILLIPS, URHO

I have reviewed the resident's note on the record and seen and

examined the patient personally.  I concur with the resident's

findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Briefly, this is an extraordinarily

complex 47-year-old patient with renal insufficiency, nephrotic

syndrome, and severe anemia who was scheduled to receive some

intravenous iron today but the presence of multiple abnormalities

in her blood prompted her to be referred here instead for

admission.  She herself complains of generalized weakness but

does not have any localizing or acute new symptoms.  Remainder of

history and physical examination were reviewed and verified and

are as noted.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert.  Speech is

normal in rate, rhythm, and quality.  Skin is warm and dry.  She

is in no distress.  She has some bibasilar moist rales but heart

sounds are completely normal.

LABORATORY DATA:  As noted and have multiple abnormalities.  It

was reflected on the record.  Calcium is 5.5, albumin is 1.7,

creatinine is 7.0, and the remainder as noted.  Electrocardiogram

does not show any acute changes.

IMPRESSION:  This patient has anemia, hypocalcemia, and

hypomagnesemia.  We discussed this with the Internal Medicine who

will be admitting her to see if they can get her in better

metabolic balance.

FINAL DIAGNOSES:

1.  Anemia.

2.  Hypocalcemia.

3.  Hypomagnesemia.

4.  Nephrotic syndrome.

5.  Renal failure.

DISPOSITION:  The patient will be admitted to hospital.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

CONDITION:  Satisfactory.
