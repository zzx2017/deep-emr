EDVISIT^47190847^JORGENSON, VIVIANLEE^05/29/78^XUEREB, VESTER

I saw this patient with Dr. Wendy Wu, resident.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Chief complaint on the chart is ataxia, when I

speak with the patient chief complaint is weakness.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This 71-year-old female with a

history of atrial fibrillation on Coumadin.  She presents with

episodes of gait instability, diffuse weakness, multiple falls. 

She was brought in by her family for further evaluation.  She

also had dark stools over the past few weeks.  She denies any

associated chest pain, shortness of breath, lightheadedness, any

syncope, any nausea or vomiting.  She does have a bruise on her

chin.  She denies any focal weakness, numbness, or tingling.  No

hematuria, no epistaxis or gum bleeding.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Congestive heart failure, atrial

fibrillation, hypertension, coronary artery disease,

hypercholesterolemia, and thyroid disease.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with family.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  As noted in the written chart and the HPI,

otherwise negative.

MEDICATIONS:  Include ranitidine, baby aspirin, Coumadin, Lasix,

and digoxin.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Temperature 96.5, pulse 60, respiratory

rate 20, blood pressure 136/60, and oxygen 95% on room air. 

General:  This is a pleasant female, elderly; she has got a 3-cm

ecchymosis over her mid left chin as well as over her left

shoulder.  Her pupils are reactive.  Neck is supple. 

Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation.  Cardiovascular:  Regular

rate.  Abdomen is soft.  Rectal is heme-positive, heme-positive

melena per the resident.  Skin is otherwise with bruises over the

left arm as well as a bruise over the right thumb that appears

healing.  Extremities are with good range of motion.  No focal

tenderness.  She is oriented x3.  Mood and affect are normal. 

She is moving all extremities equally.

LABORATORY DATA:  Chest x-ray shows no acute cardiomediastinal

process and head CT preliminary shows no intracranial

abnormalities.  Laboratory studies are remarkable for hematocrit

of 16, creatinine of 1.5, BUN of 95, troponin less than 0.04, and

platelets of 358.  INR of 2.  Urinalysis with 2+ ketones, no

blood.

INITIAL IMPRESSION AND PLAN:  This 71-year-old female presents

with generalized weakness and gait instability and frequent

falls, concerning for either an evolving intracranial process

such as a subdural or stroke.  This has been going on for several

weeks, however, but also presents with melena over the past

several weeks and profound anemia for which she required

transfusion in the Emergency Department.  We did order a CT of

the brain to evaluate for intracranial injury or abnormality both

given the frequent falls and as the cause of the falls.  This

does not show any large subdural or mass lesion.  She is quite

anemic has melanotic heme-positive stool.  I suspect this is the

etiology, but it seems like it has been a slow progression, and

concerned given her cardiac history also the weakness and could

represent coronary insufficiency.  She does not have an elevated

troponin at present.  She will need to be further monitored.  She

was transfused here in the Emergency Department given her

profoundly low hematocrit after consent was obtained. 

Clinically, feels better.  I discussed with the patient's family

because of the bleeding he will need to be evaluated as ____

further cardiac biomarkers and further monitoring as well as

physical therapy evaluation once the patient's acute medical

issues have been addressed.  She will be admitted to the medical

service with diagnosis of symptomatic anemia, gastrointestinal

bleeding, congestive heart failure, and atrial fibrillation in

stable condition.
