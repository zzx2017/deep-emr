TRIBAL INTERNAL MEDICINE ASSOCIATES          Hart, Matthew
                                              1-29-62
 
 
 
History of Present Illness: This was the first Internal Medicine clinic visit for 
this 38-year-old black male with a history of non-insulin dependent 
diabetes diagnosed a year ago, maintained on Diabeta 5 mg. q.d.  Also 
with a history of borderline hypertension previously on 
hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg. q.d. for the last year, which he discontinued 
last Sunday, who now comes in because over the last two to three weeks 
he has been having trouble with increased dizziness and headaches, and 
he is afraid that his sugar is up.  He states that over the last two or 
three weeks, he gets stars and floaters and sometimes halos of light 
followed by mild headaches.  He says that the visual changes are usually 
accompanied by the headache, and the headache is usually relieved with 
Excedrin in 5 minutes to an hour.  He does admit to a history of 
migraines but states that in the past his migraines have been much more 
severe than this, though the visual aura is very similar to his previous 
migraine aura.  
 
He states that he was seen in the emergency room on 1-12, at which time 
they did a finger stick which was about 180, and they told him to come 
to this appointment at this time.  He denies any fevers.  He does have a 
recent 25 lb weight gain and he admits to new nocturia of 2-3 times a 
night over the last three weeks.  He also has been complaining of 
diarrhea two or three times a week over the last two to three weeks, 
which is watery in nature without any blood.  He has no nausea or 
vomiting or any fever, and he has never had problems with diarrhea like 
this in the past.  His past medical history is otherwise benign.  
 
Habits:  He does have a history of cocaine abuse, and while he was free 
basing about one year ago, he came into the emergency room with chest 
pain and was told that this was secondary to lack of oxygen to his heart 
from the cocaine, since which time he has been using cocaine much less 
frequently.  He denies any tobacco use, and he drinks alcohol socially.  
He is currently unemployed and lives with his mother.  He is sexually 
active with one sexual partner and denies any other risk factors.
 
Family History:  His family history is notable for a grandmother with 
diabetes and hypertension, mother with heart disease and father with 
history of breast CA, who is currently getting radiation therapy here.  
His oldest brother died of street violence and his younger brother is 
alive and well without any medical problems. 
 
Physical Examination;  He is a mildly obese black male in no acute 
distress with weight of 270 lbs.  Blood pressure 138/88 in the right arm 
and 132/94 in the left arm.  Pulse regular at about 80.  HEENT was 
notable for normal fundi without any evidence of diabetic retinopathy or 
hypertensive retinopathy.  Oropharynx was clear.  He had no thyromegaly.  
His chest was clear.  His breasts showed no masses or discharge, and his 
                                              1-29-62
 
 
 
heart sounds were normal.  His abdomen was obese, soft, nontender, 
without any hepatosplenomegaly.  Genitalia: normal, with bilaterally 
descended testes, and his rectal exam was normal tone with brown trace 
heme positive stool.  Neurologic exam was intact. 
 
Assessment and Plan:  
 
1.   Non-insulin dependent diabetes with possible symptoms of increased 
     sugar at this time.  Will check a fasting blood sugar tomorrow 
     morning as well as a hemoglobin A1C, and may increase his Diabeta 
     to 10 mg. q.d.  He will be referred to a nutritionist for diet 
     control as well.  
2.   Hypertension: borderline hypertension at this time off meds.  I 
     will recheck his blood pressure in a week to two weeks, and if it 
     is still borderline at that time, will follow only with a low-salt 
     diet.  
3.   Trace heme positive stool: may be from his diarrhea.  I will get a 
     stool culture and O&P since the diarrhea is persistent for two to 
     three weeks, and follow it at this time.
4.   Patient requesting HIV test: and HIV counseling was given at this 
     point, and a test will be drawn, and I will give him the result 
     when it is back, though I feel that he is very low risk at this 
     time.
