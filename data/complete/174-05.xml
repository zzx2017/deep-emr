Yearly visit 63 yo man with PVD and COPD.



If he has to walk a long distance gets an aching pain in the left calf. ABI is .78 on that side. Has been coughing for a month. Yellow sputum. Has not gone on steroids. Every year this happens once. Viagra is working sometimes at 50 sometimes at 100. Apparently bone packing did not have the desired result of his cystic lesion but he tolerates this.



PMH:

He has a long hx of ischemic ulcer of the second toe of the right foot. He was admitted to the vascular service on 8/09/84 and had an arteriogram that showed complete occlusion of the SFA with reconstitution of the popliteal and single vessel run off. His pre-operative EKG raised the possibility of old ASMI although it was unchanged for a number of years. He underwent dobutamine MIBI which showed a moderate area of severe ischemia in the LAD territory. His LV was normal with EF of 59%. He underwent cath which showed complete occlusion of the LAD with collaterals from a fairly large diagonal that also had a tight stenosis. There were lower grade occlusions in the RCA territory and the LCX. He had been asymptomatic. The LAD lesion was long and totalled and not felt to be amenable to angioplasty. There were no indications to have him undergo CABG so the decision was made to PTCA the diagonal lesion to improve flow to the anterior wall. He tolerated this well.
