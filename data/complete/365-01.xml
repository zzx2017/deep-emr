                     KCM EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

RIVERS,KARSTEN   957-18-08-4                    VISIT DATE: 02/07/66

The patient was seen and examined by me.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 39-year-old man with a 

history of hypertension and diabetes, whose social history is 

unremarkable, who has a negative review of systems, and who has no 

history of any surgical procedures.  He presents with a burn on the 

right side of the neck.  He presents to the emergency department 

with a minor amount of redness on the right side of the neck and 

minor soft tissue swelling.  The trachea is midline.  The uvula is 

midline.  There is no airway compromise.  There are no airway 

complaints.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  No voice change.  The airway is patent and 

intact.  The lungs are clear, with no wheezes.  The examination 

shows a first-degree burn of the right side of the neck, with no 

blistering and no breakage of the skin.

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The patient received a tetanus shot 

and was seen by the Burn Service.  He was dressed with Bacitracin 

and discharged home.  He was to follow up in 48 hours just for a 

recheck.  The Burn Service essentially signed off on him, with no 

need for follow-up, but given this was his neck and only 

first-degree, I asked him to return here for follow-up.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  First-degree burn of the right side of the neck.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  He is discharged 

with Bacitracin ointment and analgesics, and is to follow up in 48 

hours.  The patient's condition on discharge is stable.
