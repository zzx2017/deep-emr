CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Lower extremity cellulitis.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 53-year-old diabetic

vasculopathic with a history of multiple lower extremity arterial

bypass who comes in today with bilateral lower extremity

cellulitis, has diagnosed by her PCP.  She was recently treated

at an outside hospital for bilateral lower extremity cellulitis,

had a 2-day hospital stay, and was discharged home on Keflex. 

She felt that she did have some improvement but over the past 48

hours has had worsening erythema in lower extremities.  She has

also been having some emesis, myalgias and fatigue, but has not

had any hematemesis, abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, or

other symptomatology.  She has also not noticed any urinary

symptoms of frequency.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Peripheral vascular disease, hypertension,

hyperlipidemia, and diabetes.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Amputation to the left second, third and

fifth toes, bilateral fem-pop bypasses right in 2061, left in

2066 and anterior tibial bypass graft in 05/2078.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  The patient works as a Senior Manager of Broadcasting and denies

tobacco, alcohol, or drugs.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure 146/66, pulse 98,

respiratory rate 20, temperature 101.2, and O2 saturation 99% on

room air.  General:  This is a well-appearing woman in no

apparent distress.  Respiratory:  Clear to auscultation

bilaterally, no rales, rhonchi, or wheezes.  Cardiovascular: 

Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  GI:  The

abdomen is soft.  The patient does have insulin pump in place,

but has no erythema or fluctuance over the pump.  Skin is warm,

dry, and intact with the exception of the left lower extremity,

which is erythematous, warm and slightly swollen compared to the

right lower extremity.  This erythema stops at the ankle and does

not extend up above the knee.  The patient also has an open

chronic nonhealing wound on the plantar surface of her left foot

as well.  There is no erythema surrounding this wound Neurologic:

 Awake, alert, and oriented x3 except for some decreased

sensation in her left foot, which is chronic.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  The patient was seen and evaluated

by me and the resident.  I confirm that I have seen and evaluated

the patient, reviewed the resident's documentation on the

patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and

disposition with the patient as well as the resident.

The patient had a CBC and metabolic panel.  CBC showed white

count of 14 with shift.  LFTs were within normal limits.  X-ray

of her left foot showed no osteomyelitis seen on x-ray and x-ray

of her tib-fib continued to show no osteomyelitis.  Given the

erythema and swelling, I was concerned about a cellulitis in this

vasculopathic who was also diabetic and so we gave her a 1 g of

vancomycin (especially given the fact that she has failed

outpatient therapy with oral antibiotics) and we are admitting

her to the Medicine Service for cellulitis.  The patient's

erythema and swelling does not extend to her foot and would be

extremely atypical for a DVT.  We also notified the Internal Medicine resident of the patient's admission to Medicine as she is

followed closely by Surgery and this notification was

made at 8:30 p.m.

Given the fact that she does not have osteomyelitis at this point

we have not discussed the PICC line and given the fact that she

does not have any ____ abnormalities, I did not believe that she

needs pressors or aggressive hydration and we are starting her on

maintenance fluids, antibiotics, and admitting her to the

hospital.

DIAGNOSIS:  Left lower extremity cellulitis.

CONDITION:  Stable.

DISPOSITION:  Admit to hospital.
