Team B Sub-Intern Admission Note

Wood,Cade

MR# 6691247

Date of Admission: 8/24/91

GI:  Narvaez, Guy

PCP: Suzanne, Otto



ID/CC:	Weakness 



HPI:  Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness.  Mr. Wood was at work this morning and at 9 AM he started to feel weak.  He describes the weakness as lack of energy and has normal muscle strength.  He states he really didn't have any symptoms other than weakness, but when asked about chest pain, he notes that he had mild chest discomfort, which was analogous to catching his breath after exercise.  He also describes some mild lightheadedness.  He has 2 pillow orthopnea, but he denies any fever, chills, nausea, night sweats, unintentional weight loss, syncope, HA, dyspnea, chest pain, PND, diaphoresis, palpitations, or any other concerning symptoms.  He notes his last BM was on Friday morning and states his stools have not been black or tarry, bright red, pencil thin, or watery.  He denies any abdominal pain, constipation, or diarrhea.  He notes that rest and staying out of the heat improved his symptoms, while exertion worsened his symptoms.  He has had these symptoms before in March of this year, but his symptoms today are more mild than when he presented then.  At that time he had symptoms of weakness and lightheadedness especially when standing, and he was found to have a Hct of 24.9.  He was guiac positive and was sent for a colonoscopy and an upper GI endoscopy, where a he was found to have erosive esophagitis and two cecal polyps.  The bowel prep on the colonoscopy was poor and he was asked to follow up with a repeat colonoscopy.  He was sent home on iron supplements and a PPI.  Of note, his previous colonoscopies had shown tubulovillous adenomas including a 25 mm polyp that could not be fully resected and had been   Before this admission he was seen by his worksite nurse who sent him to his PCP.  Dr. David Napolitano at Kessel Group Home saw him and transferred him to SMI for workup of severe anemia (Hct 25.4 MCV 75), dizziness, and orthostasis.

EKG:   Normal sinus rhythm.  Axis at 0.  No Q waves or ST changes

ER Course:  In the ER, he was started on IVFs and labs were sent.



Impression:  



Mr. Wood is a 58 yo M w/ Hx of colonic polyps and diverticulosis who presents with 1 day of weakness and lightheadedness secondary to a microcytic anemia.  His Hct stabilized at 26 since his transfer from his PCP's office.  His anemia is most likely due to lower GI bleeding from either his diverticulosis or from his polyposis given his guiac positive stool in the ER.  He is currently hemodynamically stable and he states he feels much better symptomatically.  Given that he hasn't had a follow up colonoscopy since the poorly prepped one in March of this year, he will probably need to be reevaluated by Dr. Narvaez.  Other possible attributing causes of his anemia could be hypothyroidism given his somewhat delayed response, but his DTR were normal.  Iron studies will be sent to confirm the probable diagnosis of chronic GI bleeding resulting in iron deficiency anemia.  He will not be transfused now given that he is asymptomatic currently and he prefers not to be transfused unless necessary.  His syncope could also have been exacerbated from his slight orthostatic hypotension as seen on PE and his high Cre and BUN indicating that he is volume depleted.  He will be adequately hydrated to correct his hypotension.  Given his chest pain and syncope, MI will be ruled out, but this is very unlikely given his clinical presentation.  His first enzymes were negative and his EKG showed no Q waves or ST changes.   



Plan: 

1)	GI Bleed

a.	Transfuse pRBCs if necessary - Consent and Type and Cross (O +)

b.	Two large bore IVs if rapid resuscitation is needed

c.	Follow Hct Q8H and watch HR and BP for signs of active bleeding

d.	Nexium 40 POQD

2)	Heme:  Anemia

a.	Send Iron Studies, TSH

b.	FeSO4 325 mg POTID

3)	CV:  

a.	Rule out MI:  Enzymes + Monitor

b.	Hypertensive:  Continue on HCTZ and Zestril

c.	Hyperlipidemia:  Continue Lipitor
