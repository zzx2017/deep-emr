Kekela Internal Medicine Intern Admission Note 


Patient Name: Gillis, Betty

MRN: 8308652

Date of Admission: 9/03/87

Attending: Mercado

Admitting Intern: Dalton Edwards

Source of History: patient, online chart





CC: SOB



HPI: 75 yo woman with a history of R MCA, R cerebellar stroke, TIAs, Iliac vein thrombosis, PFO, and recent RP hematoma and rectus sheath hematoma (at GMH 8/13/87-8/26/87) currently off of anticoagulation because of her recent bleeds. 
Pt reports sudden onset of SOB this AM.  Not associated with any other symptoms.  A contractor who was at her home at the time called EMS who took pt to hospital.  En route she developed nausea and had 1 episode of NBNB emesis.  Otherwise, she denies CP, cough, fever, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting (other than the episode in the ambulance), change in bowel/bladder habits.  No exacerbating or alleviating symptoms.  Of note, she has some residual left sided weakness from her prior R MCA stroke and some balance issues from her cerebellar stroke.



In the ED the patient was tachypnic with SATS in the low 80s and  placed on oxygen by nasal cannula with improved sats on 4L to the mid 90s.  Then was able to be weaned to room air with sats still in the mid 90s.  She also was tachycardic to the 90s with BPs to the 90/60 with one episode of BP to 78 systolic.  She responded well to fluid with 2L in the ED and improved BPs.  CT showed stable RP and rectus sheath hematomas, no evidence of DVT or iliac thrombosis, and no evidence of PE.  CXR was clear.  



Of note, following her hospitalization at PROMPTCARE in July 2087 for TIA where she was found to have a small PFO and iliac vein thrombosis, she was started on Coumadin.  However, the patient was recently admitted to GMH with rectus sheath and RP hematoma.  Per the patient, she received 8 U PRBC there.  She also received FFP and vitamin K to reverse her Coumadin.  During her hospitalization she was in the ICU for hypotension and tachycardia.  An IVC filter was placed initially but subsequently d/c&#8217;d on 8/26/87.  She was discharged off of anticoagulation.

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN

75 yo woman with a history of R MCA, R cerebellar stroke, TIAs, Iliac vein thrombosis, PFO, and recent RP hematoma and rectus sheath hematoma (at GMH 8/13/87-8/24/87) currently off of anticoagulation because of her recent bleeds.  Pt reports sudden onset of SOB at rest this AM.  



##SOB: Unclear etiology.  CT PE negative however given history of possible iliac vein thrombosis, highly concerning in setting of being off of anticoagulation in the setting of RP and Rectus sheath hematomas.  However, given her rapid recovery in the ED with nebs and oxygen and subsequent weaning to room air, there is lower concern for a PE.  History of iliac vein thrombosis is unclear and not fully imaged on CT today.  

-continue monitor SOB

-nebs prn

-consider reimaging with CT venogram to assess necessity of anticoagulation/IVC filter

-f/u GMH records



##Elevated amylase/lipase: only one episode nausea/vomiting en route with EMS.  Currently no nausea, benign exam, nl WBC.  

-CT with ?dilated pancreatic duct but no evidence of pancreatitis

-RUQ U/S for evaluation of stone disease

-consider possibly 2/2 hypotension and ischemic injury of pancreas during recent admission with acute blood loss.



## Cardiac: 

Continue home atenolol, simvistatin.  



Nutrition: NPO pending assessment of RUQ U/S

IV fluids: D5 &#189; NS +20 KCL at 125 cc/hr

PPX: GI: Omeprazole  DVT: holding anticoagulation in setting of RP hematoma   BOWEL: Colace prn

Code Status: FULL, discussed with patient

Disposition: pending w/u SOB and assessment of elevated amylase/lipase
