woman with history of coronary artery disease status post MI

stenting in 2068, presents with 3-day history of substernal chest

pain radiating to her back, and also complaining of mild pain of

inner medial aspect of her right arm, feels like her anginal

symptoms that she had in 2068 with some very mild shortness of

breath and even though she is quite sedentary and she noted that

there is an increase in pain with exertion, position, as well as

eating.  She took many Tums with no relief and says takes Zantac

chronically, but ran out of it.  She says that the pain is

burning epigastric at times, and the thing that is concerning was

her back pain that was reminiscent of the pain that she had when

she had her MI.
