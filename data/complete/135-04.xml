CARDIOLOGY

PORT HURON HOSPITAL



Reason for visit:

   77 year old woman with mitral stenosis, S/P redoMVR for thrombosed St. Jude valve, now with porcine MVR, AS, COPD, S/P R total hip replacement.



Interval History:

   Mrs. Mitchell has hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, mitral stenosis, aortic stenosis, hypertension and COPD.  She had a mitral valve replacement with the St. Jude's valve and septal myomectomy in 2085. Because of thrombosis of the valve with recurrent heart failure, she had a redo mitral valve replacement complicated by sinus arrest and AV nodal block requiring a permanent pacemaker.  She also had several episodes of syncope, once after taking an additional dose of Lasix and another in the setting of over diuresis. Repeat echo showed that her AS was not critical and she had significant LV outflow tract obstruction.

			

Other medical problems include severe COPD, trigeminal neuralgia, ruled out for temporal arteritis by several biopsies, R hip osteonecrosis, and bone spur of the right shoulder. Mrs. Mitchell is S/P total hip replacement surgery, and had her rehab atNorth Mountain Hospital. She had intercurrent admissions for overdiuresis and for flash pulmonary edema with over- and under-diuresis, respectively. She currently takes Bumex 6 mg po bid, and with this, her weight has been 140-145 pounds, which is her target weight. Her BUN and Cr are in the 25-40/1.3-1.7 range. 



Since her last visit, she has done well at home. Her breathing at home is intermittently difficult, especially if she rushes. However, oximetry shows that she is in the mid 90's at rest, and that she drops down to high 80's to 90 with exertion. She has had GI evaluation for anemia in the past, only revealing diverticulosis; her Hct was 28 recently, and Dr. Conway arranged for her to udnergo transfusion of one unit of PRBC. She feels more energetic after this. She takes Fe sulfate, but has some constipation from this.



She may require ENT surgery for vocal cord growth by Dr. Cherry. This is being considered in consultation with her LMD Dr. Evelyn Conway, and her pulmonologist Dr. Geoffrey Lucas.

INTERPRETATION:



FEV1 and FEV1/FVC are reduced, FVC is normal. TLC is normal. FRC is normal.

RV is increased.  RV/TLC ratio is increased. Resistance is increased;

specific conductance is decreased. Single breath diffusion capacity is

severely reduced, although there was only one adequate maneuver performed and

thus reproducibility cannot be assured. DL/VA is reduced. These data

demonstrate a mild obstructive ventilatory deficit. The spirometry obtained

today are similar to those from 12/14/2092. Resting room air oxygen

saturation is below normal limits, and there is significant arterial oxygen

desaturation with exertion.

Assessment and plan:

   77 year old woman S/P redo-MVR, AS, CHF, COPD, S/P R hip replacement.



Problems:



Congestive heart failure -  Her LV outflow tract obstruction and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is well compensated with metoprolol and verapamil SR. She cannot tolerate ACE inhibitors because of her severe aortic stenosis. Continue diuresis with bumex 6 mg po bid. Good BUN and Cr, weight close to target, overall euvolemic.





Chronic obstructive lung disease -  Followed by Dr. Lucas. PFT's stable.
