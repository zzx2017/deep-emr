MR#: 7045247

Date of Admission to PCH: 11/13/33

Consult Date: 11/13/33



ID/CC: 60 yo F w/FH scleroderma, personal hx of fibromyalgia, Raynaud's phenomena, GERD, HTN and bronchiectasis p/w diffuse arthralgias, myalgia



HPI: This is a 60 yo F w/a hx of fibromyalgia, Raynaud's, GERD, HTN, bronchiectasis and recurrent PNA who developed severe pain, swelling and stiffness in the MCP joints of both hands 2 nights ago. She says there was initially some redness, no warmth in these joints. She could not open or close her hands. She says the pain migrated to involve all of the joints in her hands, wrists, elbows, shoulders and knees. She noticed swelling in her R knee, no swelling or redness in other joints. Her muscles are diffusely tender. She recalls similar muscle discomfort in prior episodes attributed to fibromyalgia, although not as severe. She also remembers shoulder and elbow pain of similar but less intense character in 2128 while taking rifampin/cipro/azithro for MAC. These symptoms resolved when drugs were stopped. She denies recent fevers or chills. She completed an 8 day course of augmentin for MSSA PNA two days ago. Symptomatically she feels her PNA has resolved and she is at her baseline from a respiratory standpoint w/stable cough and SOB. She does report some mild L-sided pleuritic CP since yesterday. She denies weight loss, skin changes, rash, change in BMs, N/V, dry mouth, change in vision, weakness, paresthesias. ROS + for brittle nails, eye dryness not bothersome. FH notable for mother w/scleroderma.



Her symptoms did not respond to Excedrin and she presented to the ER 11/12. Exam notable for BP 212/93, HR 125, T 98, SO2 98%,    tenderness w/movement in UE's, R knee   . WBC 11.7, HCT 39.8, PLT 421, chem. 10 wnl, CXR w/stable bibasilar lung nodularity. She was admitted to Internal Medicine for further evaluation. She reports decreased pain with Demerol, interval improvement in hand joint swelling/erythema/stiffness.

	The faint areas of nodularity at the lung bases, slightly more

	prominent than seen on August 15, 2130.  The relative stability of

	these findings suggests an underlying benign etiology.  However,

	correlation with CT of the chest would be useful for further

	evaluation.



EKG:	NSR 80 LAD TWI V1-V5 similar to prior

____________________________________________



Impr:	60 yo F w/longstanding fibromyalgia and bronchiectasis s/p recent MSSA PNA p/w diffuse arthralgias, myalgias and pleuritic CP. The constellation of myalgias, arthralgias/synovitis, ?pleurisy, Raynaud's, GERD, HTN and +FH invoke the possibility of scleroderma. Rarely, a variant of this disease can present without skin manifestations (systemic sclerosis sine scleroderma). The transient nature of her joint symptomatology is c/w possible crystal disease. The bilateral hand distribution is typical, but progression to involve other joints such as the knee is not. Postviral arthralgias/myalgias is another consideration given the quick resolution of the process. Her myalgias may well represent underlying fibromyalgia. We recommend

  	If available, past ANA, RF, ESR

  	Please check ANA, RF, parvovirus IgM and IgG, uric acid level, U/A

  	Plain films of bilateral hands, R knee

Thank you for this interesting consult. We will follow with you.
