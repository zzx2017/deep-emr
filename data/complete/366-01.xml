                     PCC EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT

 

FERRARA,LAUREN   481-85-43-7                       VISIT DATE: 08/07/59

I have examined and treated the patient myself as well as reviewed 

and confirmed the resident's detailed documentation.

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this 68-year-old woman 

with a history of diabetes and a past history of ulcers on the 

right foot complains of increased pain on the right leg over the 

past three days.  It was worse yesterday.  It was slightly better 

today.  She has not really been able to get out of bed secondary to 

the pain, whereas she is usually very active.  She denies fever, 

chills, palpitations, and diarrhea.  She has not recently checked 

her blood sugar.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus, hypothyroidism, dementia, 

chronic ulcer of left great toe.  Past surgical history:  

Hysterectomy in the distant past.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  VITAL SIGNS:  Temperature 97.2, pulse 70, 

respirations 18.  Blood pressure was initially 241/90.  HEENT:  

Within normal limits.  NECK:  Within normal limits.  LUNGS:  Within 

normal limits.  HEART:  Normal except for a 3/6 systolic ejection 

murmur.  ABDOMEN:  Soft and nontender.  EXTREMITIES:  Normal pulses 

throughout except that most of the pulses are heard only by 

Doppler, and on the left posterior tibial and dorsalis pedis pulses 

there is no Doppler pulse available.  The lower extremities are 

both cool and somewhat modeled to the mid thigh.  Toes are somewhat 

dusky.  There is a 5 x 5-mm shallow ulcer on the medial aspect of 

the left great toe.  

THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  The Orthopedic Service was 

consulted and did AVIs and PVRs which indicated an ischemic lower 

extremity with a question of aortoiliac disease versus thrombus.

CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Orthopedic Service.

FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Arterial insufficiency.

DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 

being admitted to the Orthopedic Service, is not being heparinized 

at present; and a decision of angiography or MRA will be 

considered.  The patient was admitted to the hospital in stable 

condition.
