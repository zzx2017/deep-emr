HPI:  Ms. Stephenson is a 57-year old woman who has a history of multinodular 
goiter status post a hemithyroidectomy 7 years ago, and 
non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus for the past 10 years complicated 
by diabetic retinopathy.  She also has had a TAH and is on Premarin 
replacement.  She has had only one prior visit in Internal Medicine one year ago with 
Dr. Eric Olds, and since then has been seen for med refills by nurse 
practitioners.  She has had no specific complaints, has been relatively 
compliant with her medicines although her understanding of her disease 
process appears to be limited.  She currently is taking Micronase 10 mg. a 
day, an aspirin a day, and Premarin .625 mg. a day.  She describes 
intermittent symptoms of hyperglycemia, although she follows her blood 
sugars with urine dipsticks and says that they have been running in the 
non-detected range most often.  She has not had any new visual blurring, 
excessive polydipsia or polyuria.  She has not been taking her Synthroid 
medication for the past year since she last saw Dr. Olds, since she ran out 
of the medication.  She has made no effort to get a refill on this, and 
has not noticed any significant difference.  She denies excessive fatigue, 
palpitations, constipation, or lethargy, yet she inquires today about 
potentially restarting this medicine.  She has no other specific 
complaints.  She has a good energy level.
 
Social History:  She works at Nvidia and lives with her son.
 
Allergies:  None.
 
Habits:  She does not drink.  She had quit smoking a year ago, but has 
been smoking this past week due to some stresses at home, and is planning 
on stopping this.
 
Physical Exam:  Blood pressure 148/83.  Pulse 70 and regular.  HEENT exam 
reveals a palpable right thyroid lobe and an absent left thyroid lobe 
without specific nodularity or tenderness.  She has no adenopathy.  Her 
oropharynx is clear.  Her chest is clear to auscultation.  Cardiac exam:  
regular rate and rhythm, S1, S2, without murmurs or rubs.  Her abdomen is 
obese, soft and non-tender.  She has abnormal pigmentation across her 
skin, including her palms and her soles of her feet, and no peripheral 
edema.
 
Assessment/Plan:
 
1)   Diabetes mellitus.  Will continue on Micronase 10 mg. a day, check a 
     hemoglobin A1C, and send her to the eye doctor.  We have talked about 
     good foot hygiene, and she will continue to check her urine 
     dipsticks.  
 
2)   History of multinodular goiter. I will send a TSH today to assess her

     need for Synthroid replacement.
 
3)   Routine health screening.  She does not need a pap smear.  She has 
     had a TAH; however, I will perform a mammogram on her today.  She 
     will come back and see me in one month to get the results of these 
     tests, and we will make treatment decisions at that time.
