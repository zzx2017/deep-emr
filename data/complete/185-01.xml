ED Attending Physician Note

HPI

See NP note for full details. Briefly, this patient has history of back pain, L buttock and leg pain for which he has been scheduled for an outpt open MRI next week. The pain was worse in the last few days such that he has had difficulty walking due to pain. He does not have any weakness or numbness no loss of control of bowel or bladder. No fevers/chills. Has hx of prostate CA which certainly puts him at risk for spine mets.

ROS

otherwise neg

Vitals

See Nursing Notes

PE

See NP note for full exam.

Neurologic exam: A & O x3, CN 2-12 intact, motor 5/5 all ext, sensation intact to light touch throughout, nl gait, normal finger-to-nose bilaterally, neg pronator drift. Pt reports that after having received pain medication he is now able to walk, whereas he wasn't earlier this evening when he first arrived because he was in too much pain.

Medical Decision Making ED Course

75M w/acute on chronic low back and left buttock pain, now improved after pain medication in the ED. The patient has no neurologic deficits at this time and is able to walk without assistance. Given the patient's history of prostate CA, he certainly needs further radiographic evaluation of his spine to evaluate for mets and should undergo MRI to assess for disc disease as well. Pt was offered MRI today, however he is certain he cannot tolerate a traditional closed MRI (he has tried before with medications). Given that the patient does not have any neurologic deficits, it is safe for him to be discharged home on an improved pain regimen with stool softeners as well and f/u with his already scheduled outpt open MRI next week. Pt and family understand to return if pt develops any neurologic symptoms.

Condition on Discharge

Stable

Diagnoses

Back pain

Review Comments

I have personally seen and examined the patient and confirmed the resident's examination, reviewed and agree with the resident's documentation of history, and discussed the evaluation, plan of care and disposition of the patient with the resident.
