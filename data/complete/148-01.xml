Dear Dr. Quentin Carlson

Etheridge, Shari (94482315)



83 year old woman with history of COPD, HTN, NIDDM who presented with shortness of breath and bilateral pedal edema.  Ms. Etheridge was given lasix with a good response.  Her shortness of breath resolved.  Her EKG was normal and her cardiac enzymes were flat.  It was felt that she had tracheobronchitis with sputum production and consequently treated with azithromycin.  She will continue on her nebulization and steroid taper for her underlying COPD.  Mr. Etheridge was discharged on March 19, 2087
