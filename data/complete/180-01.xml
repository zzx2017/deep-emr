RE:  Peggy Tinsley
     MR #236-67-03-3
 
Dear Dr. Ventura:
 
Peggy Tinsley was seen in the renal clinic today.  This patient
with end stage renal disease secondary to diabetes was initiated
on hemodialysis 2 weeks ago in MH.  She has been doing well
except for the complaint of fevers and rigors intermittently for
the past week.  There is no history of cough, dyspnea, or chest
pain.  She denies any dysuria, urgency, or frequency.  Her blood
sugars at home have been between 120 and 180.  
 
Her current medications include Tums 5 to 6 tabs with meals,
Erythropoietin, Premarin and Provera, Nephrox 150 mg tid, insulin
NPH 10 units qam.
 
On July 17, after hemodialysis, Ms. Tinsley was given a partial
dose of Vancomycin and developed pruritus.  CBC at the time
revealed a white count of 6.2 with a hematocrit of 25.2.  Blood
cultures were sent.
 
On examination today this lady appeared well with a BP of 110/60
and a pulse of 88.  She was afebrile.  Head and neck examination
was unremarkable and chest was clear to IPPA.  On cardiovascular
examination JVP was at the sternal angle and there was no
peripheral edema.  Heart sounds were normal.
 
Urinalysis did not reveal and white cells and contained 3+
protein and 2+ glucose.
 
Miss Tinsley should be followed up at her dialysis center. 
There does not appear to be any evidence of a graft infection. 
She should also have a urine sent for culture to rule out urinary
tract infection.  Because of her early satiety she has been
eating poorly and we might suggest that she be started on a
gastroprokinetic agent such as Cisapride 10 mg qid.
