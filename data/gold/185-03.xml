	Interval History:

   75 yr old male who is admitted with new onset chest pain. Pt has a hx of significant   AAA  repair in '31and newly diagnosed nonoperable pancreatic cancer. During evaluation of pancreatic cancer, CT revealed pseudoaneurysm of aortic graft. Before start of chemotherapy, pt underwent surgical repair of pseudoaneurysm. 

2/16/51 Pt had successful surgical repair of the pseudoaneurysm, complicated by a intraoperative NSTEMI with a peak troponin of .36. 

2/20/51 echo done showing EF of 70%.

2/22/51 cath revealing LM normal, LAD 40% stenosis after D1, 95% stenosis at ostium of D1 and LCX 80% at the takeoff of OM2 with 70%ostial OM2 lesion, and RCA non-dominant with no significant disease.

Because pt was not having any symptoms of angina, the decision was made not to intervene on the LCX lesion and to stress the pt at a later date.

Currently pt is to begin treatment of his pancreatic cancer with chemotherapy and radiation.  Today pt was to have his first treatment, but starting having chest pain and was sent to the ER for further evaluation. 

Recently for the past three days, pt reports on and off chest pain lasting 4-5 hours with raidation to jaw and left arm at rest and excertion. No assciated symptoms of SOB or diaphoresis. Pt thought he was having heartburn symptoms.

In the ER, EKG showed mild lateral ST depression in V5-V6, initial troponin neg and chest pain relieved with one SL nitrogylcerin. Heparin started and pt transferred pain free to Cardiology.   Upon arrival, pt had one episode of chest pain, EKG showed no acute changes, chest pain relieved with one SL nitrogylcerin.
