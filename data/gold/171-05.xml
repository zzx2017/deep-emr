Internal Medicine Admission Note 



PATIENT: John Usry

MRN: 6762675

PCP:  Dr. Xena Acuna

ATTENDING PHYSICIAN: Dr. Quinton Quintela

HCP/FAMILY CONTACT: 



CHIEF COMPLAINT: &#8220;I came to the hospital b/c I have pneumonia&#8221;



HPI: This is a 84M with CAD s/p 4V CABG in 2091 who presents via transfer from Waverly urgent care after a chest xray showed pneumonia. The patient first presented to Waverly on 10/22 with complains of weakness, fatigue, decreased appetite and bilateral shoulder pain for a few weeks. He denied dyspnea, chest pain or pressure, productive cough, sore throat or runny nose. He was noted to have a fever of 101.2 at Waverly but denied other subjective fevers. His daughter had recently been hospitalized with pneumonia but he has no other sick contacts. At Waverly labs were drawn, a chest xray was done and he was given motrin and Tylenol and sent home. He returned for follow up the next day feeling no better. His labs reviewed a leukocytosis and acute kidney injury and his chest xray showed a RLL pneumonia. He was sent to the CGH for further evaluation.



On presentation to the ED at 1pm on 10/23, his VS were 98.2, 87, 122/60, 97% on 2LNC. He got 500cc of NS, Levaquin 750mg PO x 2, Ceftriaxone 1gm IV x 2 doses, his home doses of dilantin, finasteride and plavix and sent to the floor. 



Upon arrival to the floor he was in no distress. In addition to the above, he denied recent vomiting, diarrhea or feelings of numbness or dizziness. He has had less appetite recently. He denied injury or trauma to his shoulder which he said had been bothering him more and more for the past 3 weeks. 



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS: As per HPI. Other systems reviewed were negative in detail.

RECENT DIAGNOSTIC STUDIES

RH Cath (3/97) DIAGNOSTIC CONCLUSIONS/OVERALL SUMMARY:


1. Right heart catheterization - normal filling pressures. Hemodynamics: RAP 


1, RV 25/2, PAP 25/6, PCWP 6, CO 5.73


2. RV biopsy was performed using a shor sheath through right internal jugular 


vein approach.


3. A total of 4 biopsy obtained, fixed in formalin and sent to pathology. 


Closing RAP 2.

Nuclear Stress 12/96 CONCLUSION

       The ECG is negative for ischemia.  The sensitivity of

       adenosine-induced ST segment changes for detecting CAD is limited.

       LV contractile function is normal.

       The perfusion iamges show a large area of mild ischemia involving

       the anteroseptal and inferior walls



TTE: 11/96. EF 60%, mild/mod MR and inferior wall motion abnormalities.

RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES

Chest Xray: Airspace opacity in the right lower lobe compatible with acute pneumonia. Small right pleural effusion. 

Shoulder Xray: No evidence of acute displaced fracture, dislocation or bone

     destruction.



EKG: NSR @89. slight LAD. Normal intervals. Left atrial enlargement. Incr RBBB (seen in V1) No ST segment changes. ?Q waves in III and aVF. ECG on 10/22 shows Mobitz II Heart block.

      

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN: 84M with CAD s/p CABG presents with malaise, fatigue and shoulder pain x 3 weeks, found to have RLL pneumonia on chest xray. He has been stable since coming to the floor. 



ISSUE #1: CAP: Likely organisms include pneumococus, atypical infections such as h. influenzae, mycoplasma or legionella. Viral causes are also possible. As is superinfection with an organism like Staph aureus if he has influenza. 

-          Levaquin 750 QOD x 7 total doses

-          Will check blood cultures, sputum culture, legionella urinary antigen

-          Will rule out for influenza and keep on droplet precautions

-          Titrate O2 sats for &gt;96 %



ISSUE #2: AKI: Likely prerenal azotemia as has improved with IVF given in ED.

-          C/w IV hydration with normal saline

-          Will pursue workup if creatinine remains elevated.



ISSUE #3: CAD: No complaints of coronary symptoms, ECG shows known Mobitz II. Will optimize medical regiment. BNP elevated but no other symptoms of volume overload.

-          C/w statin, aspirin

-          Aim for SBP &lt; 130 in this diabetic with CAD. C/w norvasc.

-          Will add captopril 6.25 TID and titrate to goal given diabetic with proteinuria

-          Per old PCP notes, patient is not a candidate for b-blocker. Will f/u this issue with PCP.

-          Will recheck AM BNP and hold all IVF.

-          Monitor on tele





ISSUE #4: Diabetes: Medically managed at home. F/s AC+HS with RISS. Diabetic Diet.



ISSUE #5: Seizure disorder: c/w dilantin. Will check level. 



FEN:  Diabetic diet.
