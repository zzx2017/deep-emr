ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  



(1)  Bronchitis/laryngitis. Chest x-ray today is clear. I elected to go ahead and treat

     him with doxycycline 100 mg b.i.d. for the next 10 days. He does have

     follow-up with his neurosurgeon in the next 10 days or so.



(2)  Health maintenance. Double check on LFTs and A1c since his LFTs and blood

     sugars were up in the hospital. Also check a CBC.
