	Reason for visit:

	Interval History:

     She had previously been on the CVH pancreas transplant list and had full cardiac workup including recent dobutamine echo which revealed normal LV function and no ischemia.   However, there was concern about her extensive visceral and iliac vascular calcification by CT which rendered her high surgical risk.    She is understandably upset about this reclassification and is here today for an overview of her cardiac status.
