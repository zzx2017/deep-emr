 Attending Note


I performed a history and neurological examination of the patient and discussed his management with the resident.  I reviewed the resident's note and agree with his documented findings and plan of care.


The patient is a 71 year old man with HTN, DM and high cholesterol, PPM on coumadin for AF, glaucoma, who presented 4 w/a with R facial droop and dysarthria lasting &lt; 1 minute.  Was admitted for TIA w/u and CT scan was negative.  CTA was also normal.  He had had a similar episode in the UK in the past. Was started on a statin and ASA and discharged.  His wife feels he may not be that compliant but his INR was 2.3 today.  It had been 2 when he came in with the TIA&gt;


The exam today showed:
Acuity was 20/70 OD and Hand motions OS.
Left APD
Fundi with large C/D OD and diffuse pallor OS with an opticociliary shunt vessel along the nasal disc.
Right facial weakness in the sense of eyebrow drop and less wrinkles in the forehead but smile equal.  Was not in UMN fashion.
Motor, sensory, gait otherwise normal.


Assessment:  
Status post TIA possibly related to AF

Left optic neuropathy with signs of chronic compression or ischemia.  The latter is more likely cause (especially since I did not see any mass lesion compressing the L optic nerve on the CT) and is proably secondary to glaucoma.


Plan:
Reviewed coumadin food rules with him.
Continue 
ASA and coumadin and statin
Continued HTN and DM control
Will touch base with ophthalmology regarding the left optic neuropathy

Return in 6 months.
