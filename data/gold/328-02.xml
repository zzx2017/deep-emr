MICROBIOLOGY

Urine culture MEDIQUIK 7/10: &gt;100,000 mixed 3 organisms (contamination)



RADIOLOGICAL STUDIES



Left hip xray (7/13): 
Status post left hip replacement. New bony fragment (since 6/29/77)

     superior to the left femur, likely from the greater trochanter



Left hip CT (7/13):  

1) heterogeneous density 6.6 x 8.9 cm intra-muscular soft tissue collection within the muscle planes in the left supero-lateral aspect of the left hip

2) smaller soft tissue collection within the subcutaneous fat anterolateral to the left hip measuring 4.7 x 7.9 cm

Impression: There at least two soft tissue collections are seen within the soft tissues surrounding the left total hip replacement, which have high density components likely representing hematomas.  The superior lateral collection appears intramuscular.  The inferolateral collection is within the subcutaneous fat.



TTE (6/2077): Mild MR. Left atrium enlarged at 36 mm. Moderate TR with prominent Eustachian valve. Normal LV cavity with EF 64%. Normal RV function with RVSP 44.



EKG

Irregular tachycardia with nml uniform appearing P-waves and narrow QRS; ?atrial tachycardia with variable block versus sinus tachycardia with dropped beats (similar pattern observed on EKG dated 6/29/77)

            

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

87F w h/o HTN, HLP, DM, hypothyroidism, and now 2 weeks s/p left hemiarthroplasty after L femoral neck fracture who p/w fatigue at MEDIQUIK and was found to have an 8.5-point hct drop. 




1) hct drop &#8211; likely post-op hematoma, unlikely other source of bleeding

- follow hct bid

- if pt c/o recurrent pain, or if exam changes, will obtain repeat hip xray

- transfuse if hct shows evidence of active bleeding (hct&lt;28 in AM) and symptomatic

- guaiac stools



2) s/p hemiarthroplasty

- WBAT per ortho

- PT consult for inpt assistance; maintain troch off precautions (no active abduction)

- f/u ortho recs from attending 7/14 AM



3) tachycardia &#8211; 2/2 anemia (resolving with stabilizing hct), volume depletion, post-op 

- follow telemetry

- replete lytes

- up-titrate beta-blocker if tachycardia persists on 7/14 following hct stabilization

- follow fever curve, CBC



4) heme

- started lovenox 30 mg bid on PM of 7/13 given risk of DVT (last anticoag 7/12 AM)

- d/w ortho re: risk of re-bleed versus risk of DVT



5) DM

- bid fingersticks, RISS if necessary



FEN: ADAT, D5NS at 80cc/hr for now



PPx

DVT: lovenox 30 bid for now

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn
