Attending Admission Note



HPI

52 year old woman with DM and h/o gastroparesis who presented with nausea and vomiting.  She was last admitted one week ago with N/V and treated for gastroparesis.  Her diabetes has been poorly controlled with her last hemoglobin A1c over 12 in April of 2081.  She has had recurrent episodes of nausea and vomiting.  During this past year in January, she was admitted to Missouri Baptist Hospital.  She had a negative EGD, and HIDA scan showed low ejection fraction to cholecystokinase.  She underwent a laparoscopic cholecystectomy.  She was admitted again a few weeks later to Missouri Baptist and had a gastric emptying study, which was consistent with gastroparesis.  In February, she was seen in the Philadelphia State Hospital Emergency Room with nausea and vomiting and had a KUB, which showed significant stool.  She presented again on 02/11/2081 and had an abdominal CT that showed thickening of the terminal ileum and possible thickening of the gastric and possible duodenal wall.  GI was consulted and the colonoscopy done on 02/14/2081 was normal, but did not visualize the terminal ileum.  A small-bowel follow-through on 02/16/2081 was normal.  She was discharged on a regimen of Reglan and erythromycin.  Since February, she has been seen multiple times in the outpatient clinic as well as medical walk-in.  She reports being complaint with her regimen of erythromycin 250 mg four times a day and Reglan 10 mg twice a day.  She was also recently started on Glucophage titrating up to 1000 mg b.i.d. as she had difficulty with multiple short per day regimen of insulin administration.  



She was admitted from 5/31-6/2 and treated with IV Zofran and enemas.  GI saw the pt and recommended increasing reglan to TID and adding colace and miralax.  She also had a head CT to r/o mass lesion causing the nausea, and this was negative.  At the time of d/c, her nausea had decreased.  She states that the N/V did not improve much since that admission, and she has not been able to eat much.  She has pain throughout her abdomen.  She denies f/c, diarrhea, constipation, dysuria, hematemesis, or melena.
