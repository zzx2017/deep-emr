Attending MD Notes:76  yo man had recent R knee replacement, now with complaint yesterday of vertigo /lightheadedness while walking at rehab.  Today he had r sided cp and he had some more lightheadedness.  Sent to ED for evaluation.
PE avss
well appearing man in nad
head nc/at
eyes eomi perrl
neck supple, no bruits
chest clear
cor nl s1s2
abd soft ntnmnd
ext r knee--wound clean, no pus, no drainage.  + edema.
neuro a/o x 3 m/s intact, although r leg decreased strength secondary to pain

a/p :  pt had surgery about one month ago but d dimer is elevated.  Due to chest pain we will r/o PE.  Issue is that this pts. creatinine has been high previously, although today it is 1.4.  We will attempt to get a vq scan in a.m.  Clear cxr bodes well for useful nuclear scan study.  If low prob can d/c back to rehab.
I have examined the patient and discussed with the Nurse Practitioner the patient's care and agree with the plan. [vw892]
