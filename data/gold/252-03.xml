Dear Dr. Taylor:

 

Mrs. Joshi returns for followup.  Currently, she complains of

exertional fatigue, exertional dyspnea, and mild peripheral

edema.  Since last seen, she has continued to find it quite

difficult to lose weight, and has thus far declined seeing

members of our obesity clinic.  As you know, in the past, she

also has declined any consideration of attempted cardioversion or

other invasive studies.  Presently, she remains on a regimen of

enteric-coated aspirin 325 mg p.o. q.d., simvastatin 20 mg p.o.

q.d., metoprolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d., isosorbide nitrate 60 mg p.o.

q.d., Avapro 150 mg p.o. q.d., Actos 45 mg p.o. q.d., potassium,

10 mEq p.o. q.d. Pumex 2 mg p.o. q.d., Coumadin, magnesium oxide,

Humulin insulin 20 units subcutaneous q. a.m. along with 50 units

subcutaneous q. p.m., and Humalog 26 units subcutaneous q. a.m.

 

Physical examination reveals a markedly overweight woman in no

acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting at 106/62,

heart rate 65 and irregularly regular, respirations 16 and

unlabored, weight 306 lbs, which is 6 lbs above her weight 10

months ago.  The neck is soft.  JVP is flat.  Carotids without

significant bruits.  Chest is clear.  Cardiac exam reveals a

normal S1, a physiologically split S2, with a1-2/6 systolic

murmur radiating from apex to the base.  No significant diastolic

murmur or rub.  The abdomen is obese, but otherwise benign.

Extremities reveal 1-2+ bipedal edema, peripheral pulses are

intact albeit mildly diminished.

 

Electrocardiogram shows atrial fibrillation with a variable QRS

response.  The P waves are more organized than one might usually

see, suggesting the possibility of fibrillation/flutter as well. 

QRS 0.11, QT 0.38, axis 90 degrees, there is evidence of a prior

inferior myocardial infarction.  Compared with his last

electrocardiogram, there is no significant change.

 

Impression:  Mrs. Joshy continues to suffer from morbid obesity,

and I had a long discussion with her and her daughter regarding

the essential nature of her engaging in an aggressive weigh

reduction program.  I once again have strongly encouraged her to

make an appointment with our obesity clinic to assist in

extensive weight reduction.  I also discussed with her my

concerns regarding her symptoms of slowly progressive peripheral

edema, particularly as it pertains both to her weight, and atrial

or tachyarrhythmias.  As in the past, she told me that she would

refuse any consideration for attempted cardioversion or other

studies.  She did, however, agree to continue with her current

medical regimen.  I obtained routine blood studies today to

verify the adequacy of her lipid control and diabetes management.

 I have introduced her to Hayden Nutter, her nurse practitioner, who

will assist in trying to achieve a little more diuresis overt he

next few weeks.  We have given her a prescription for Zaroxylyn

to begin at 2.5 mg p.o. q.d., which will help result in some

degree of mild diuresis.  Nonetheless, she understands that

significant weight loss can only occur through a weight reduction

program.  I have of course explained to her the increased cardiac

morbidity associated with her current lifestyle.  Beyond this, I

have not altered her current medical regimen.

 

Of course, I thank you for allowing me to assist in his care.

 

Sincerely yours,

 

Dictated By: Brandon Neilson
