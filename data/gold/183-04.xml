HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This is a 59 year old female who 
presents to us with shortness of breath tonight.  She has been 
developing shortness of breath now with nausea and vomiting today. 
There is no history of fevers, no chills, and no abdominal pain. 
She does complain of some mild flank pain but nothing significant. 
She has had chronic back pain for years. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  The patient has a significant past medical 
history.  History is significant for hypertension, diabetes, and 
congestive heart failure.  She is status post total abdominal 
hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and status post 
L5-S1 laminectomy. 
MEDICATIONS:  The patient is on multiple medications including 
Lasix, lisinopril, prednisone, Premarin, nifedipine. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Here the patient looked mildly 
uncomfortable.  Blood pressure was 151/58, oxygen saturation was 99 
percent, and heart rate was 98.  Blood pressure has remained stable 
since she has been here.  Heent examination was normal.  Pupils 
were reactive normally bilaterally.  Oropharynx was clear.  Neck 
was mildly obese with no jugular venous distention.  There were 
good carotid upstrokes, no bruit.  Lungs had some crackles 
two-thirds of the way up and some rales at the bases, one-half way 
up.  Cardiac examination revealed S1 and S2, somewhat tachycardic, 
with a 2/6 murmur.  Abdomen had multiple striae and was soft and 
non-tender, with good bowel sounds.  There were good pulses 
throughout.  Extremities were normal. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Electrolytes here were normal.  Blood sugar 
was normal.  White count was 14, hematocrit 34.  Initial CK was 
140, troponin 2.6.  Chest x-ray showed moderate effusion and a 
small left effusion.  Patient's last echocardiogram showed an 
ejection fraction of 60 percent.  This echocardiogram was done in 
February of 2096.  She also had a second echocardiogram in April of 
2096 which showed an ejection fraction of 55 percent, with moderate 
MR.  EKG here showed ST depression in V6 and some decreased T's in 
aVR and aVL.  Sinus rhythm on EKG rated about 100. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  In the Emergency Department the 
patient was heparinized.  She was placed on oxygen, given an 
aspirin, and placed on a Nitroglycerin drip.  She also received 
some Nitropaste here.  She also received a mg of Morphine.  SFOC 
Cardiology was aware of the patient's troponin of 2.6, indicating 
that she had a myocardial infarction or could still be evolving a 
myocardial infarction here.  She received IV Lasix 60 mg here and 
responded very well.  She was diuresing considerably and her 
shortness of breath appeared to be much better than when she 
arrived here in the Emergency Department. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Congestive heart failure with myocardial 
infarction, diuresing well and responding to medications. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient was 
admitted to the CCU.  SFOC is aware.  She remains in stable 
condition here and is going to be transferred up to CCU in a little 
while.  Condition at this time is satisfactory.
