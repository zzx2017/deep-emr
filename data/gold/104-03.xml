PCP:				Dr. Mia Tapia (Legacy Center)



Reason for admission to CCU:  

45 yo F w/ h/o DM, HTN, hypertriglyceridemia, tobacco use p/w SSCP and inferior STEMI. Treated w/ Reteplase for successful resolution of STE.

     

HPI: 

Pt with above CVD risk factors and HCV developed "10/10" SSCP/pressure accompanied by nausea and diaphoresis while at rest evening of admission at approximately 11 PM. Pain had no radiation to back, jaw, L arm. Pt had no syncope, palpitations, light headedness. EMS activated and initial vitals P 62 BP 124/palp RR 16. Described as pale, dry. STE noted in inferior leads, V4R not elevated. Pt provided w/ ASA, TNG spray and 250 cc bolus. 



In ED, T 96.1 P 60 BP 75/45 RR 18. Provided ASA 325, heparin bolus at 5000U and 1000 U/hour, MSO4. STE noted inferiorly.

Imaging:

CXR - poor inspiration, low lung volumes w/ soft tissue, mild cardiomegaly, early failure.



EKG:



5/15/97 02:37

Sinus brady w/ rate 50; inferior STE, 1-2 mm; biphasic apical TWI; lateral TWI, likely reciprocal changes; slight LAE.



Assessment/Plan:



45 yo F with multiple medical problems, particularly obesity, tobacco history, DM presenting with significant EKG changes in inferior distribution. Because the cath lab was occupied, ward cardiology opted to forego delay and treated her with Reteplase x 2 with excellent results, including resolution of symptoms and resolution of EKG changes.



1.	Ischemia.

Now on plavix, statin. 

Has received ASA several times during this evaluation. Allergy is GI upset. Clarify with aim of continuing daily ASA for vascular prophylaxis.

Continue heparin peri-event period.

Needs ACE I for remodeling as well as risk reduction as pt has DM.

She merits further definition of her coronary anatomy by catheterization in 1-2 days. Lysis has risk of restenosis, plus may have additional lesion of borderline significance.

High risk for post-lytic restenosis; follow daily EKG, symptoms, markers.

If pt unwilling to undergo cath, then echo plus stress test for characterization of risk stratification.



2.	Pump.

Slightly volume overloaded, can administer lasix 20 IV now.

Echo to evaluate post-event remodeling, define anatomy and physiology.

Advance lopressor as tolerated.



3.	DM.

Checking sugars QID. Holding hypoglycemics.

She will require tight control peri-infarct.

	Cont medications for glaucoma.



4.	Psychiatric.

Pt's out-pt regimen will be maintained during this hospitalization. No indication for psychiatric consult.



5.	Hypothyroidism.

Maintain on current dosage of levoxyl w/out checking TFTs during hospitalization.



6.	Chronic pain.

Cont neurontin.

Provide low-dose narcotic as previously scheduled on out-pt med list.

7.	Prophylaxes.

Nexium; on heparin post-event.
