Rad:	

PA/Lat CXR: 	   Minimal hazy opacity in the left lower lobe which may represent subsegmental atelectasis or consolidation.  Platelike subsegmental atelectasis of the right lung bases.    NGT below the diaphragm



KUB/Upright: Mechanical SBO vs adynamic ileus

Assessment/ Plan:  84 yo F, clinically with an SBO, likely due to adhesions. At this time, the patient is hemodynamically stable without peritoneal signs. She does not have a leukocytosis.

1.	Admit to the RSH Surgery Service

2.	NPO/IVF, NGT LCWS

3.	Strict I+Os

4.	Serial abdominal exams

5.	If the patient does not have resolution in 24-48 hr, we recommend CT abdomen/pelvis to evaluate obstruction. If she clinically deteriorates, we recommend exploratory laparotomy

 6. Will hold plavix and ASA in event of operative procedure
