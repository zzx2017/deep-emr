Referring Physician:  Dr. Kenyon, Dr. Elmer Ure, Vallejo General 
Cardiology.  
 
Referring Diagnosis: Status post cardiac transplant. Rule out 
osteoporosis.  
 
HPI:  Patient is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of lymphoma, 
diagnosed in 2070 when he presented with left axillary enlargement.  At 
the time, he was staged by bone marrow transplant which was negative.  
Whether this was a Hodgkin's or non-Hodgki's lymphoma is unclear to us, 
but he was treated with bleomycin, adriamycin and prednisone for 
approximately 26 weeks.  At that point, he was believed to be in 
remission and stayed in remission since then.  
 
In 2077, the patient was first diagnosed with diabetes mellitus when he 
presented with polyuria, polydipsia and blurred vision.  Subsequently he 
was treated with oral hypoglycemic agents for one to two years and since 
that time has been on insulin therapy, currently on 64 units of NPH and 
six of regular in the morning with 30 NPH and six of regular pre-supper.  
He currently checks his blood sugars four times a day and runs in the 
100-200 range with average being about 130 and is followed by Dr. Nicodemus 
Paz of Queenstown, WI, his primary care doctor, for this.  The patient's 
complications of diabetes mellitus are possibly non-existent.  There is 
no peripheral neuropathy.  There is no autonomic neuropathy.  No retinal 
disease.  However, the patient does have renal disease, with baseline 
creatinine currently of 2.4.  
 
Recently the patient developed congestive heart failure with initial 
symptoms in the early 80s.  By June of 2082, the patient had fairly 
severe symptoms requiring hospitalizations and in the period of July 
2082 to June of 2083, the patient apparently had 5 myocardial 
infarctions.  In June 2083, the patient underwent orthotopic cardiac 
transplant here at the VGH under the care of Dr. Quentin Fitzpatrick.  Since 
that time, the patient has done very well without evidence of rejection 
with relatively good exercise tolerance and with basically a minimum 
degree of symptoms.  
 
The patient's current medications include cyclosporine 150 mg. twice a 
day; prednisone 8 mg. a day.  Azathioprine 250 mg. a day; Axid 150 mg. 
twice a day; Cardizem 300 mg. a day; baby aspirin once a day; Cardura 4 
mg. once a day; and amitriptyline 25 mg. a day for cramping in his legs.  
 
Review of Systems:  Has had one fracture of his right ring finger that 
was from a trauma some years ago.  Other past medical history includes 
history of sleep apnea and depression and the things mentioned.

Family History:  His sister, aged 54, and mother, have osteoporosis with 
his mother having fairly severe osteoporosis with a normal of vertebral 
collapses and some nerve damage.  His father and mother have had 
diabetes mellitus, his father dying of heart disease.  There is a 
19-year-old daughter who has a history of migraines.  There is no 
history of thyroid disease in the family.
 
Social History:  He currently works at Belkin and has a desk job 
there.  He quit smoking and drinking 15-20 years ago.  He has been 
married for over 20 years.  His review of symptoms revealed the absence 
of GI symptoms.  There were no orthostatic symptoms, no angina.  Normal 
sexual function.  He denied any skin problems or rashes.  He denied 
numbness and tingling in his feet, etc.  There is a history of 
hypertension.  
 
Other review of systems:  His height has been stable at 6'2" tall.  
 
Physical Examination:  Blood pressure 130/93.  Heart rate 96.   The 
patient is a well-appearing gentleman, somewhat obese.  His height is 
6'2".  Weight 294 lbs. which is apparently steadily been increasing.  He 
has a mild Cushingoid appearance with a little bit of posterior cervical 
and supraclavicular fat.  Retina appeared without lesions.  Normal 
extra-ocular movements.  His oral mucosa was moist without evidence of 
thrush.  Neck exam:  He had a supple neck with no carotid bruits.  
Normal thyroid.   His chest exam revealed clear lung fields with normal 
excretion.  There was no bony tenderness or abnormalities on his back.  
His cardiac exam:  He had a soft, S1, S2.  Cardiac exam otherwise 
unremarkable.  His abdomen was soft.  He had some evidence of insulin 
injections, but no significant hypertrophy.  He injects both in his 
abdomen and rotates with his arms.  His extremities revealed minimal 
stasis dermatitis, normal pulses, and were symmetric.  No edema.  
Neurologically he was diffusely hyporeflexic.  He had normal to slightly 
decreased vibratory sensation in his big toes.  
 
Laboratory Exam:  Most recent laboratories that I could find were 
February 09, 2084.  Sodium 141.  K 5.1; chloride 105.  Bicarb 20.  BUN 
39.  Creatinine 3.4; glucose 136.  His CK was 219.  Calcium 9.7.  
Albumin 4.3; phosphate 4.0.  Alkaline phosphatase was 90.  Uric acid 
5.1; magnesium 1.9.  TSH was 1.6.  Cholesterol 242.  Triglycerides 226.  
His cyclosporine level was in the therapeutic range at 273.  His CBC 
revealed a hematocrit of 43 and a white count of 8.9 thousand with a 
normal differential.  
 
Assessment and Plan:  This is a 48-year-old gentleman with a history of 
multiple medical problems.  The one's most pertinent to us currently are

the fact that he is post-transplant, has several risk factors for 
osteoporosis, including prednisone use and a family history of 
osteoporosis.  The total amount of exposure to prednisone sounds like it 
is about a year-and-a-half or so with half a year during his 
chemotherapy 14 years ago and then about a year since his transplant.  
The patient's history of never having had fractures, no bone pain, no 
height loss and his body habitus are consistent with someone who might 
be somewhat more resistant to osteoporosis than many transplant 
patients.  However, getting a bone density study in the patient like 
this makes sense.  We will therefore schedule a spinal bone density on 
his follow up visit, since he cannot have one today for scheduling 
reasons.  We will also check vitamin D levels given patient's history of 
renal failure and the fact that the one thing that we might be able to 
do for him is to give him vitamin D.  His calcium intake was estimated 
to be about 1,000 mg. a day including one cup of milk, green leafy 
vegetables and one cup of ice cream each day.  We would be a little 
reticent about starting higher doses of calcium given his renal failure, 
without more information about this patient.  The patient's diabetes 
seems to be in pretty good repair at the moment with blood sugars under 
fairly good control, sounding like they are in the 130 range although we 
don't have access to hemoglobin A1C.  Given the fact that it sounds like 
he has got pretty good care by Dr. Paz, we will not pursue this at 
the current time unless asked, and we will focus primarily on the bone 
situation.  Otherwise, we will see the patient back or at least talk to

the patient after we get a bone density and decide when he next needs to 
be seen.
