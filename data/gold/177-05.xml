ID:  T2 N 0 M X, ER/PR + Her 2 Neu negative left invasive ductal carcinoma


Reason for visit: Monitoring of adjuvant endocrine therapy for breast cancer


Initial Oncologic History:  
Ms. Ito first palpated a left breast lump in 2070. Two years later she was seen by her PCP and referred to surgery. In March '72 a mammogram showed a 1.6 cm left breast mass at 12 o'clock, also evident on ultrasonography. An additional group of indeterminate microcalcifications was noted in the upper outer quadrant of the right breast. 
On 3/22/72 a biopsy of the left breast mass confirmed invasive ductal carcinoma. Stereotactic core biopsy of the upper outer quadrant calcifications showed only fibrocystic changes. On 5/31/72 she underwent a L lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy.  Pathology revealed a 2.0 x 2.5 x 2.3cm invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 3,  with negative margins, ER+PR+Her2neu-, sentinel node negative. She was then referred to multidisciplinary clinic and received a recommendation for whole breast irradiation and adjuvant endocrine therapy.


INTERVAL HISTORY:  
Returns to see us for regular 6 month follow up. She had follow up chest imaging with her PCP which did not show evidence of pna. She is happy to hear this. She reports she is doing well at home. Son agrees. He is in the process of remodeling her home so it is handicap accessible. She can dress herself and wash herself. No new breast symptoms, pain or other concerns today.
