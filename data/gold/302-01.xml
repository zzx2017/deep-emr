SUBJECTIVE: The patient returns.  She has had three
operations on her back, finally ending with a fusion of
L2-L3 and a laminectomy in that area for recurrent disk
disease  at L2-L3.  She still is having severe pain going
down her right leg and anterior knee which is unchanged or
perhaps somewhat better.  She sees Dr. Herring with
regularity.  She has seen Dr. Oscar Riggs.  She has
nothing wrong with her hips and she has had multiple CT
scans showing the numerous operations and fusion.  

MEDICATIONS:  
1.  Lipitor 20 mg q.d. 
2.  Glynase 1.5 mg b.i.d. 
3.  Trandate 100 mg q.d.  
4.  Tegretol 300 mg in a.m., 200 mg in the p.m.  
5.  Premarin 0.625 mg 30 days a month.  
6.  Provera 5 mg 12 days a month.
7.  Enteric-coated aspirin 81 mg q.d. 
8.  Calcium 1200 mg q.d. 

She is in physiotherapy presently. She is not smoking nor
drinking.  She has been eating and has gained considerable
weight.

She has no cardiopulmonary, GI or GU complaints.  She is to
see Dr. Bruce Godfrey's replacement in August and to get a
mammogram at that time.  Hopefully, she will be able to lie
on the table when that occurs.  She is now able to drive a
car, but walks with a cane and cannot lie down with any
degree of ease.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She weighs 192 lbs stripped and her
blood pressure is 160/90 in the left arm standing, pulse is
72 and regular.  She appears as a well developed, overweight
white female in pain, having to hold on while standing,
easily weeping, but pleasant.  There is no icterus, cyanosis
or edema.  The eyes reveal 2+ arcus.  Pupils are round,
reactive and equal.  Nose and throat examination is
unremarkable.  Neck veins are flat.  Carotids are 2+ and
equal and without bruit.  Thyroid small and smooth.  Lungs
are clear to P&A. The heart is not enlarged.  There is a
regular sinus rhythm and no significant murmurs.  S1 and S2
are normal.  Liver and spleen cannot be felt.  She has good
peripheral pulses.

IMPRESSION:  
1.  Diabetes mellitus type 2.  She has had an eye exam at
Mitchel Memorial Hospital this past year, but her diabetes is poorly
controlled as her blood sugars have been in the 150-200
range.  I have told her to increase her Glynase to 3 mg
twice a day until she is able to diet.
2.  L2-L3 disk with fusion. 
3.  Mild hypertension, on no medication.  Will not start any
until she loses weight.
