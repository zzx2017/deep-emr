Vascular Surgery Admit H+P

Name:  Nathan Vieira
Medical Record:  #0666729
Date of Evaluation:  12/13/78
Attending:  Dr. Atwood

CC:  L leg/foot pain

History of Present Illness: Pt is a 71 yo M s/p bilateral fem-pop BPG   s by Dr. Atwood who had been previously asymptomatic walking up to five miles without claudication, after his R BPG in Feb and L BPG in April of this year.  He in fact saw Dr. Atwood on 11/10 and had a good DP pulse at that time on the left.  However, one week ago he sat on the floor for ~3 hours doing electrical work, flexed at the hip and slightly flexed at the knee, and that night he began to have calf and dorsal foot pain on the L side.  This lasted for ~24 hours.  He went to his PCP who was concerned that he may have compromised his graft given he had a diminished DP pulse on the L, and also had developed an area of erythema on the L lateral calf which the PCP suspected to be cellulitis.  He was prescribed keflex by his PCP which he started on 12/10, and the patient reports his erythema has improved since starting the abx.  He then revisited Dr. Atwood who found diminished trace DP pulse on the L, possibly secondary to graft kinking and/or thrombosis, and advised the patient to be admitted today for likely angiogram and possible thrombolysis in the AM.  On ROS he has had no F/C/N/V/D/abd pain/back pain.
