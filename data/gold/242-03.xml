Dear Mr. Louis, 





It was very nice to see you again the other day.  I hope you are doing well.  I am writing to let you know about your recent test results.  





The following tests were essentially negative, normal, or unchanged from prior testing and do not require follow-up at this time.

1) Kidney test.

2) Cholesterol.  Your cholesterol results are as follows:

     Total Cholesterol = 129,

     HDL (the 'good' cholesterol) = 43,

     LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) = 70,

     triglycerides = 82.

My records indicate that your total cholesterol has increased since 01/11/2072.  Given your medical history, we would like to keep your LDL (the 'bad' cholesterol) below 100.  Please continue to follow a heart-healthy diet.

3) Hemoglobin A1c.  This is a blood test that indicates how well you have controlled your blood sugar over the past 3 months.  For patients with diabetes, we would like to keep it below 7.  Your Hemoglobin A1c value was 6.5 on 04/04/2073.  It has remained stable compared to the last value of 6.5 on 07/12/2072.  Please continue to check your sugars regularly and take Metformin as prescribed.

4) X-ray.  No fractures were detected on the X-ray of your spine, but it did show changes consistent with osteoarthritis.





The following tests were abnormal or require follow-up.

1) PSA.  As we discussed during our visit, this is a blood test that measures activity in your prostate, and is one way to measure your potential risk of prostate cancer.  This is not a perfect test, and its use for prostate cancer screening is controversial.  My records indicate that your PSA has mildly increased since 4/01/72.  I recommend that you follow-up with a urologist for a prostate biopsy, which we can arrange when you return for your follow-up appointment.  At that time, we will again discuss the specifics of the PSA test and the risks/benefits of different treatment/follow-up options.





If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach me at my office at 191-537-1871.  I will see you on 5/16/73 at 9:40am for our next appointment.
