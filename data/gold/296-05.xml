CC: swollen left knee 


HPI:  The patient is a 60 year old female with a history of renal transplant, CAD s/p CABG, diabetes who present with with abrasion and swelling of her left knee.


Patient was well until December 12th when she slipped on ice and fell on her left knee.  Patient initially noted an abrasion and some ecchymosis around the knee joint and been weight bearing without difficultly.  Patient reports frequent falls at home due to her neuropathy but is ambulatory without assist.  On December 19th, she noted some erythema around the knee joint and the lateral aspect of her shin and started developing pain and swelling that slightly limited her range of motion.  She also noted some knee stiffness.  Denies any drainage from injury site.  Patient did speak to the NP at her PCPs office and was advised to be evaluated in the ED.


ED course:  On arrival, the patient&#8217;s vitals were: 99.2 80 109/66 97%/RA.  Per report, a tap of the left knee was attempted but no fluid could be aspirated.  Blood cultures yielded GPC in pairs in &#189; bottles.  Patient was started on vancomycin and developed an itchy rash at the infusion site (right arm).  Patient was switched to linezolid per discussion with transplant ID.  Of note, she had new lateral V5-6 TWI but cardiac enzymes have been negative x2.


ROS: Missed last night&#8217;s dose of lantus.  +subjective fever, some nausea.  gets short of breath with exertion (stable).  some blood mucus in osteomy last week.  snores at night and wakes up from some sleep.  intermittent blurry vision (stable).


Denies hitting her head.  No chest discomfort/pain, abdominal pain, change in urinary habits.  No vomiting.  No change in frequency/consistency of stool

hypertension
SVC syndrome with SVC stent on warfarin INR goal 2-3, followed by AMS
CAD s/p CABG 2096: 

Complicated by sternal osteomyelitis
to LAD, SVG to the PLV-OM and diagonal
Cath (09/09/2099): severe native three-vessel disease, the to the LAD was patent. The saphenous vein graft to the diagonal was patent. The skip saphenous vein graft from the diagonal was not visualized and seemed to be obstructed. The left circumflex was subtotally occluded and this territory was consistent with the area of ischemia on her stress test. not amenable to stenting and has been medically managed.  
TTE (07/27/2101):  inferior posterior hypokinesis with an EF of 47%.  no significant valvular heart disease.  Mitral inflow patterns were restrictive consistent with elevated LA pressures and/or a non-compliant 
Adenosine stress test (8/04/01): fixed posterior, lateral and inferior defects without ischemia


ALLERGIES:  Erythromycin &#224; unknown.  Vancomcyin &#224; rash
MEDICATIONS ON ADMISSION:  Prograf  2 mg QAM and 1mg QPM, ASA 81 mg QD, Folate 400 mcg QD, Prilosec 40 mg QD, Imdur 30 mg QD, Fludrocortisone .05 mg QD, Imuran 100 mg QPM, Toprol XL 25 mg QPM, Lipitor 40 mg QPM, Celexa 20 mg QPM, Coumadin 4 mg QPM, MVI QD, Calcium + Vit D 600 mg QD, , Fosamax 70 mg qweek, Lantus Insulin 5 units qpm, Humalog Insulin 1- 10 units (scale) w/ meals and snacks

ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:  The patient is a 60 year old female with a history of renal transplant, CAD s/p CABG, diabetes who present with with abrasion and swelling of her left knee.  Positive blood culture may be contamination but given patient&#8217;s comorbidities, will proceed with course of antibiotics.  Blood cultures are growing GPC in pairs and patient has history of MR-CNS and patient had rash with vancomycin so will keep on linezolid for now.  Patient does have history of MR and ?endocarditis but will hold off on echo given patient is afebrile and hemodynamically stable.  If surveillance blood cultures continue to be positive, will consider adding gentamycin and checking echo.

Cellulitis:  Linezolid x 14 days (12/21-1/03); f/u blood cultures; check surveillance blood cultures; PICC c/s after blood cx negative x48 hours.  f/u ID recs.  PT/OT consult.
Renal/Lytes: continue tacrolimus and check daily levels per transplant.  f/u transplant recommendations.  slightly high K this am, likely due to missed insulin.  Will monitor for now.
CV: complete rule out; keep on telemetry for now given hyperkalemia and EKG changes; continue home regiment
GI: continue omeprazole, will make outpatient GI aware
Diabetes: continue outpatient regiment of lantus + insulin SS with meals.  Will check blood sugars AC + 10 pm + 2 am per endocrine
Psych: will hold celexa while patient on linezolid given risk of serotonin syndrome
F/E/N: diabetic diet
Ppx: warfarin, omperazole
Code status: presumed FULL
