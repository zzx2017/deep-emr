HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman with type I diabetes who comes in today for followup.  We have had heron the insulin pump now for close to six months and recently she had had continuous blood glucose monitoring.  We had gone over these results over the phone and I had made some adjustments.  Particularly she seems to have some late morning hyperglycemia and we decided to change her carbohydrate to bolus ratio during the morning hours and this has resulted in tremendous improvement in her blood sugars.  She brings them in today and the results look excellent.  She has had no other concerns of late.  We have not tested her hemoglobin A1c in a long period of time, so she comes in today for further evaluation.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Significant for the type I diabetes as described, her pernicious anemia, C6-C7 vertebral degenerative disease, pulmonary embolus and also some mild asthma in the past.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Otherwise unremarkable except for what is listed already in the HPI.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is generally awake, alert, in no acute distress.  She is 66.5 inches with a weight of 167.5 pounds, which gives her a BMI of 26.7.  Her blood pressure is 110/62 and her pulse is 86.  Generally, she is awake, alert, in no acute distress.  HEENT:  Normocephalic and atraumatic.  Pupils equally round and reactive to light.  Extraocular movements intact.  Cranial nerves II through XII are symmetric and intact bilaterally.  Fundi are unremarkable.  Lungs are clear to auscultation bilaterally.

Neck exam reveals no jugular venous distention.  Carotids are 2+ with normal upstrokes.  Thyroid is 20 g without nodules.  Extremities are without clubbing, cyanosis or edema.  Neurologically, she is alert and oriented x3 and has a grossly nonfocal exam.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:
1.  Ms. Zastrow is a 67-year-old woman who comes in today with review of her type 1 diabetes.  She is doing much better on the pump than she was before especially with the recent adjustments we made.  We will continue with the pump and she will continue to send me her blood sugars every two weeks until we get this under control.  We will check a hemoglobin A1c today.  She is up-to-date with the remainder of her health maintenance including seeing a podiatrist and an ophthalmologist as we had prescribed.
2.  Cardiovascular.  She is doing well on her current regimen.  She is on ranolazine and will continue with this.
3.  Neck pain.  Intermittent neck pain is most likely from degenerative disease.  I did not find anything on neurological exam that was concerning.  I did encourage her to actually take some Naprosyn as needed for this pain, but not to take it on a continuous basis for long periods of time.  She has had some problems with some blood in the stool and I feel that she is due for colonoscopy.  I did recommend that she get one in the near future.  

ADDENDUM:  A pelvic exam was with normal appearing female external genitalia.  Normal vaginal vault, no adnexal fullness felt.  Vaginal Pap was taken.  Greater than 50% of our 60-minute visit was spent going over her pump settings, the appropriate levels for her pump, going over her diet, going over her bowel habits and her etiology of possible blood in her stool.
