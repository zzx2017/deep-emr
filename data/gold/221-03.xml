CARDIOLOGY

KELLIHER CARE CENTER



Reason for visit:

   F/u of coronary disease and hypertension.   



Interval History:

   Ted continues to feel well. He has not taken nitroglycerine for 6 months. He exercises for 25 minutes 3 days per week on the treadmill and does not get chest pain. He does continue to gain weight because of dietary caloric indiscretion. He is not having any edema or orthopnea. 



Family history:

   Brother has been diagnosed with prostate cancer. 



Physical examination:

-General:   No acute distress.

-Skin:   No rashes, anicteric.

-Heent:   Unremarkable

-Neck:   Carotids 2+ without bruits. JVP no jugular venous distention.

-Chest:   Clear to auscultation and percussion.

-Cardiac:   Left ventricular impulse discrete and nondisplaced. Regular rate and rhythm, normal S1 and S2, with no S3 +S4. There were no murmurs, clicks or rubs.

-Extremities:   No cyanosis, clubbing or edema. 2+ femoral pulses without bruits. 2+ pedal pulses.

-Neuro:   A&O x3, CN 2-12 grossly intact. 

-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds, soft and has mild epigastric tenderness, with no hepatosplenomegaly or masses appreciated.

-BP: 127/55  

-Pulse: 43  

-weight: 185  lbs.

-BMI:   



EKG:

   Sinus rhythm, intraventricular conduction defect, poor RWave progression, unchanged from previous.





Impression:

   Ted continues to do well. I discussed with him the reason for his persistent positive stress test and the posterolateral redistribution being related to the circumflex occlusion. There is good collaterals to this territory and I told Ted he needs to continue to exercise to build up those collaterals. We will repeat a stress test on him next spring to make sure he has not had progression of disease in his other arteries.
