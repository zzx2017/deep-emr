-check iron levels

-would obtain MRA of mesenteric  vessels to look for mesenteric ischemia (PVD, HTN, CAD, etc).

-hold off on colonoscopy for now given risk for perforation.

-cycle cardiac markers, continue antiHTN and anti-ischemic regimen.

-consult GI and cardiology if clinical conditions worsen.
