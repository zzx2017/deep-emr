History of Present Illness Pt. presents today for f/u of her overnight stay in the EDOU from 2/20 to 2/21/67.
 
She went by ambulance on 2/20 when she noted slurred speech and an unsteady gait.  She says it was like she was a drunk.  She hadn't been drinking and hadn't taken or eaten anything unusual.  She was very scared.  No visual changes or other unusual sensations.  She hadn't been sick in any other way:  no fevers, chills, N/V, or other complaints.
 
She felt a tiny bit better and was able to go to the door and let the EMTs in.  They checked her sugar:  63.  They gave her some sugar gel and her Sx resolved.
 
In the ER, her Sx did not reappear.  Labs were notable for BS of 140 then 255.  (A1C on 12/27/66 was 7.8.)  Her Na+ was low @ 124 &amp; 126, but this is stable for her.    She had a normal MRI/MRA.
 
Since then, she has felt her usual self.

1)  Spell.  DDx includes hypoglycemia vs. TIA.  Still not completely clear which.  That said, she's doing well and that is reassuring.  She needs to check her sugars if she has another spell.  For now, we'll follow her closely.  
 
2)  HCM:  Deferred today.
 
Follow-up:  RTC as previously scheduled.
