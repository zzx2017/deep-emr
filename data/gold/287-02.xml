	GRETNA COUNTYHIROPRACTIC CENTER
	


	Reason for visit:
   S/p PFO closure using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device on 12/05/63


	Interval History:
   It is a pleasure seeing Mrs. Xuereb in f/u s/p her PFO closure on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.  
Her history is also signigicant for s/p STEMI the morning after arthroscopic shoulder surgery for adhesive capsulitis in 10/63, Protein S deficiency, COPD, HTN and dyslipidemia. 

She is doing well from the cardiac perspective-reporting that her PAC's have decreased in intensity and occurance-now happening 2-3x/day, and denies any further neurological events. 

She does, however, c/o a constant HA (feels as though her head is in a 'vice'), did not have pre-procedure. She does have a hx. of migraines, and reports that she has not had one since her closure. She is using Tylenol w/ good relief.  Thinks it is d/t the Toprol XL.  


	Past medical history:
   1. CAD-s/p IMI following shoulder surgery with evidence of acute thrombotic occlusion of her RCA; no other atherosclerotic lesions identified.  ? paradoxical emboli.  s/p thrombectomy with Export catheter - 10/04/2063
2. PFO with large right to left shunting
3. Protein S deficiency (? secondary to estrogen replacement)
4. Adhesive capsulitis R shoulder; s/p arthroscopic surgical repair 10/3/2063
5. May Thurner Syndrome- seen by Dr. Jones - no intervention needed
6. GERD
7. Dyslipidemia
8. HTN
9.  DM2 (diet controlled) - HgbA1C elevated for about 3 yrs
10. S/p Partial hysterectomy
11. h/o small bowel obstruction
12. COPD

Allergies: Augmentin - rash

	Family history:
   Mother: died at 72 - colon CA
Father: died at 82 - ? PNA. Hx of DM, COPD
Siblings: 12 siblings - all alive and well


	Social history:
   Divorced.  3 grown children. Works at Calista Co., veterinarian for exotic animals.

	Review of systems:
   No lightheadedness, dizziness, presyncope or syncope. 
No hx of TIA/CVA/migraines/seizures

Physical examination:
	
-BMI: 24.4  Normal, low risk
-Pulse: 66  NSR
-height: 68  in.
-weight: 160  lbs.
-General:   Healthy, in NAD
-Neck:   Supple.  JVP &lt;5cm.  Carotids 2+ with good upstroke and no bruits.
-Chest:   Lungs are clear to auscultation anteriorly
-Cardiac:   Apical impulse is nondisplaced.  Rate and rhythm regular.  S1 S2 without murmur/rub/gallop.
-Abdomen:   Normal bowel sounds.  Nontender.  No hepatosplenomegaly or aortic enlargement appreciated.
-Extremities:   LE: warm, dry, no edema

-BP: 112/72  mmHg


	EKG:
   NSR-66bpm.  


	Other Data:
   1/26/64-TTE:
MITRAL VALVE 
There is no evidence of mitral valve prolapse. There is mild mitral regurgitation by color and spectral Doppler. 
LEFT ATRIUM 
There is no evidence of left atrial dilatation. 
AORTIC VALVE, AORTA, LVOT 
There is no evidence of valvular aortic stenosis. The aortic valve is tricuspid. There is no evidence of aortic insufficiency by color or spectral Doppler. 
LEFT VENTRICLE 
The left ventricular cavity size is normal. The left ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. There are no obvious segmental wall motion abnormalities. There is a false tendon within the LV cavity which is a normal variant. The estimated ejection fraction is 65 %. 
TRICUSPID VALVE - IVC, SVC 
There is color and spectral Doppler evidence of mild tricuspid insufficiency. 
PULMONARY VALVE, INFUND., P.A. 
There is evidence of trace pulmonary insufficiency by color and spectral Doppler. The RV systolic pressure was estimated from the regurgitant tricuspid velocity (assuming an RA pressure of 10mmHg). The estimated RV systolic pressure is 33 mmHg. 
RIGHT VENTRICLE 
The right ventricle is not dilated. The right ventricular systolic function is within normal limits. 
INTERATRIAL SEPTUM, INTERVENTRICULAR SEPTUM 
There are increased echoes along the interatrial septum c/w a closure device. The appearance of the device is most c/w an Amplatzer device. There is evidence of a patent foramen ovale by agitated saline contrast after Valsalva maneuver. 
PERICARDIAL DISEASE AND EXTRACARDIAC MASSES 
There is no evidence of pericardial effusion. 
CONCLUSIONS 
Compared to the report of 12/06/2063, there is residual shunt with the valsalva manuever. 




	Assessment and plan:
   In summary, Xian is a 56-year-old female s/p myocardial infarction, likely the result of paradoxical emboli via a large PFO, and s/p closure of her PFO on 12/05/63 using a 25 mm Crybiform Amplatzer device.  She is doing well from the cardiac perspective, and denies any further neurological events.  Upon our review of the echocardiogram there is a trace shunt across the device (7 beats, only after Valsalva) consistent w/ intra-pulmonary shunting.  We are willing to try decreasing her Toprol XL to 12.5mg qd, in an attempt to alleviate her HA's.  If this proves unsucessful, we will trial a course of Atenolol.  We agree with continuation of her ASA therapy and will see her in f/u for her 6 month appointment in June w/ an Echo w/ bubbles.
