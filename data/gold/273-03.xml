January 29, 2077



Interim History:	

Comes to review her medical problems.

Her ETT showed mild distal anterior and antero-apical ischemia. The last p-CABG ETT was done in September, 2074, and did not included nuclear images. The electrocardiographic portion of both tests was considered to be uninterpretable because of inadequate elevation of the heart rate. Dr. Dotson asked her to double the atenolol dose. Since she has had low BP in the past, we increased it to only 25/12.5. BP 80/50-90/60 at home and she has not felt so well, tired. Not sure whether the dyspnea on exertion that led us to get the ETT has changed since she has not challenged it. 



Home Blood Tests:  Not very good by history. A1c over 9%. She still has trouble focusing on it. 

Retinopathy:	Visions stable.

Nephropathy:	Cr slightly up to 1.5

Cardiac:	above

Vascular:	No claudication



Past Medical History: 

Has had flu shot this year.



Review of Systems: above



Physical Exam:	

Looks well.

BP:   110/76   120/80 by me (not sure she took meds this AM)		P:   72, regular	

Wt:   167 without shoes, up 4

Neck:	No JVD

Chest:	Clear to auscultation

Heart:	Normal S1; ? physiologic S2.  No gallops.  No murmurs

Extremities:	No edema.            





Impressions and Plan:	

Reduce the captopril to 6.25 mg bid.

Report back BP; may have room to go up to 25 mg bid on the atenolol.

She does have some hypoglycemia and symptoms are sometimes subtle. Stressed the likely greater difficulty in perceiving hypoglycemia on beta blockers. 

Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine



Appointments:	As scheduled
