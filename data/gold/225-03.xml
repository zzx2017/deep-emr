	OXFORD DELTA CLINIC
	


	Reason for visit:
   s/p Coronary angiogram with placement Cypher stent to LAD


	Interval History:
   The patient is a 70 yo male with a history of HTN, hyperlipidemia, DM, CAD and CABG September 2092 which was c/b premature graft failure of the SVG to LAD. Cardiac catheterization was performed in Jan 93 and underwent POBA of likely diffusely diseased, intramyocardial LAD, but never really improved. He was admitted to ODC in May 94 and cath demonstrated severe native disease with a mid-LAD lesion which was treated with PTCA/ Taxus stent. He had symptomatic relief until about one month ago when he began to experience exertional discomfort and dyspnea which has now progressed to symptoms at rest despite an aggressive medical regimen. He presented today for cath which revealed a new stenosis distal to the prior LAD stent which was patent. The lesion was stented with a 2.25 x 13 mm Cypher stent. he is now admitted to the Cardiology department for post procedure monitoring and arrived to cardio clinic pain free and hemodynamically stable.


	Past medical history:
   DM 
HTN 
Hyperlipidemia 
CAD -CABG x 3 September 2092 WMMC (LIMA to D2, SVG to RCA, SVG to LAD) s/p PCI prox LAD Jan 2093, s/p Taxus stent to LAD 5/94 
GERD s/p H pylori eradication several years ago 
Left rotator cuff injury s/p CABG 
Anxiety 
hernia repair

	Impression:
   70 yo male with CAD s/p CABG with early LAD graft failure s/p LAD stenting 5/94 now with recurrent symptoms found to have a new LAD stenosis that was Cypher stented today.


	Assessment and plan:
   CV:Pain free and hemodynamically stable, HR and BP in good range continue current medical regimen and monitor 
DM:Diet controlled, monitor FSBS and cover as needed
