all those shoes had become tight.  At the present time, the

patient is only able to wear sandals and apparently her

co-workers noted her to be significantly swollen and suggested

that she see a physician.  The patient states that there was no

acute change in her swelling today.  She states that she has had

a cough for 1 month.  Again, there was no acute change.  Today,
