Physical Exam

Chest clear

Cor S1, S2 normal, no murmurs

Abd obese,  no masses

Extremities no edema, no ulcers ,dorsalis pedis pulses intact 

Neuro    Vibratory sense intact  Monofilament testing intact



Impression

My impression is that her type 2 diabetes requires basal insulin administration while she is NPO and on iv D5W. She should have regular insulin for coverage q 6 hours rather than Novolog while NPO because this will provide 'smoother" coverage



Recommendation

My recommendations are:

1.Please administer NPH 20 units q 12 hours while NPO

2.Change ss to regular insulin q6hours while NPO

3.When taking po and iv D5W has been stopped start Novolog 5 units plus scale pre-meals( liquids to start) and dc regular insulin scale
