scrotal swelling and lower abdominal pain.  The pain has been

intermittent and the patient has been taking Vicodin for the past

except for the left-sided flank pain and the chest pain.  He was

found on the ground by his daughter, and it was unclear to the

strength in his left hip or knee because of pain.  He is alert

and oriented to person, place, time, and event.  His cranial

nerves are intact.  Rectal examination shows mildly decreased
