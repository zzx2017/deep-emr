Reason for visit:

   Mr. Cortez is seen in follow up for ASMI, sleep apnea, coronary risk factors, glucose intolerance, obesity.



Interval History:

   The patient relates that he's been feeling reasonably well.  He complains of lightheadedness when he lies down which is lasting only seconds and disappears the instant he puts his head on his pillow.  He took one TNG over the past 6 months for indigestion like sensation.



He doesn't have any exertional syndrome to suggest angina.



No syncope, pre-syncope.  No palpitations, no recent weight loss.







Social history:

   Continues to work.  Looking forward to Spring work in his garden.

Sleep apnea HISTORY OF



Obesity



Glucose intolerance HISTORY OF





Assessment and plan:

   Mr. Cortez is doing reasonably well.  



I think it would be reasonable to obtain a stress test because he is not significantly active, has glucose intolerance and should be periodically screened for coronary artery disease progression.



LDL goal should be 60-80 and Lipitor is increased to 20mg hs in this regard.



BP goal should be 120 systolic and Lisinopril is increased to 20mg from 10mg in this regard,.



He is strongly encouraged to pursue weightloss this Spring.



F/U 6 months.



ETT before visit.







EKG:

   Sinus rhythm, borderline left axis deviation, right bundle branch block with anteroseptal MI, no acute changes
