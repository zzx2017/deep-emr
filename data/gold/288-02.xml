Ms. Bird comes in today to follow up on her weight and blood sugar 
control, as well as to discuss her overall mental status and its effects 
on her living situation.
 
PMH:  Her past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, status post 
renal allograft, status post aortic and mitral valve replacements with a 
mechanical valve, on chronic Coumadin, a recent aortic aneurysm repair 
and complications around that, including a cellulitis which has been 
treated, and now waxing and waning mental status.  She also is 
insulin-dependent diabetic.  
 
MEDICATIONS:  Her medications currently include:
1.   Neurontin 300 t.i.d.
2.   Insulin NPH 20 units in the morning, 10 in the evening.
3.   Fosamax each day.
4.   Premarin and Provera.
5.   Tums Extra-Strength.
6.   digoxin 0.25 and 0125.
7.   Mevacor 40 a day.
8.   Coumadin 1mg each day, except Sunday 2mg.
9.   Imuran 100mg a day.
10.  prednisone 20mg every other day.
 
REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  The patient notes that she has been feeling well and 
more active.  She is able to walk around her house without her walker.  
She does use the walker outside of the house for safety and precaution.  
She is independent in bathing and washing, as well as cooking and 
preparing meals.  She, however, is requiring a lot of assistance with 
managing her medications.  She has her daughter-in-law downstairs help 
her with this.  She has not been out of the house much in the last 
several months, and, while she wants to drive, no-one has allowed her to 
get behind the wheel.  
 
The patient otherwise feels well with no chest pain, no shortness of 
breath, no change in her bowel or bladder.
 
HABITS:  She has had a weight which has been stable, and her appetite 
has been good.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Notable for a well-appearing female who walks 
with a walker, slowly, but in no acute distress.  Her weight is 104 lbs.  
Her blood pressure today is 130/72.  Her pulse is 80 and regular today.  
She has no peripheral edema, and she is comfortable sitting in a chair.
 
IMPRESSION:  My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is stable with 
her current regimen and medications.  We have been manipulating her

Coumadin to keep her INR between 2 and 3.5 and, most recently, it was 
2.5, earlier this week.  She will continue on her current medications, 
as noted above.  
 
The bulk of the discussion was regarding her home situation and her 
mental status.  She has clearly improved her mental status gradually 
over the last several months.  She is anxious to drive.  However, 
everyone in the family who is with her at the visit and her visiting 
nurse agree that she is not mentally sound enough to be behind a wheel.  
I explained this in no uncertain terms, and also set a milestone in 
management of her own medications.  Hence, our three goals that we set 
today were:
1.   Management of the patient's own medications, which she was doing 
     six months ago.
2.   To get out of the house at least once a week, using either 
     community transportation or a family member.
3.   To be doing the family's laundry each week.
 
While the patient was not happy about being told that she could not 
drive, she understood the reasons and was satisfied with the goals that 
we set.
 
Hence, I will see her back in about six weeks and see how she is doing 
with these goals.  As well, we will continue to have the visiting nurse 
see her every other week to monitor her blood sugar and Coumadin.
