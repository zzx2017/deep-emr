                             OFFICE NOTE
 
Uher, Olga
258-16-49-2
04/20/64
 
She returns to clinic for follow up. Unfortunately she missed her
entire appointment and did not bring her blood glucose log with
her. She reports that at 4 a.m. last Thursday she woke up and felt
disoriented with sweats. She checked her blood glucose, it was 50,
and she treated herself by eating. This led to resolution of her
symptoms, although she said that she overshoots. She has developed
a foot infection, has been seen by a podiatrist and started on
antibiotics. She has also been taking a thyroid hormone but she
still feels that it is making her tired. She just in general has
not been feeling as well as she had been previously.
 
Past Medical History:
 
1.   IDDM.
 
Medications: See previous notes.
 
Allergies:  Same.
 
Physical Examination:  Not performed. The patient had a  special
orthopedic shoe on, her foot was wrapped.
 
Impression:  Patient with IDDM with usual blood glucoses in the
200's and an elevated A1C. Discussed the need for consistent meals
and exercise and need for more control. Will increase day time
insulin to 17 units of Lente and evening will stay at 10. She will
follow up in one month. Will check a TSH today.
