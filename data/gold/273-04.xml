Interim History:	
Comes to review her medical problems.

Has lost weight thanks to some spring viral illnesses     she is pleased about it.
Reports that her control has not been good and does not have records.
No severe hypoglycemia.
Retinopathy:	Still has not seen Dr. Aragon. No subjective change in visual acuity.
Nephropathy:	Cr 1.7 in January. Has not seen transplant MDs in a couple of years. Formerly saw Dr. Hayes. 
Neuropathy:	No foot discomfort.
Cardiac:	Has occasional high substernal chest tightness, every couple of weeks, over about 6 months, unrelated to exercise. Can last up to 15 minutes. Has not become more frequent. Sees Dr. Dotson annually. Has sensation about weekly that she cannot swallow, liquids>solids. Has had this for over a year and it has not been progressive.  
Vascular:	No claudication.

Past Medical History: 
Medications: wants to reduce costs     asks about generics for Lipitor, transplant meds. 

Family History: 
Wendee has been profiled in the media because of her work as an industrial engineer 

Social History: 
Jake is well. His parents have been ill. 

Review of Systems: above
Psych: Referred to urologist at KJH, Dr. Xayachack (? sp) because of absent libido. He made the switch from Celexa to Wellbutrin and added Androgel and DHEA. She has noted more acne or no more libido. The loss of libido precedes the Celexa and the possibility of its relationship to Neoral or CellCept has been raised. 
She sees her gynecologist regularly.

Physical Exam:	
Looks remarkably well.
BP:   160/98   170/88		P:   60, regular	
Wt:   153 without shoes, down 15
HEENT:	Anicteric. 
Fundi:	Limited views; laser scars; some ? fibrous bands OS. No active lesions seen.
Carotids:	Normal pulses, without bruits
Thyroid:	20-25 grams, firm without nodules.
Chest:	Clear to auscultation
Heart:	Normal S1; physiologic S2.  S4.  2/6 systolic ejection murmur

Extremities:	No edema.  Pedal pulses all 1-2+ except L PT not palpable.           Small blister, resolving L 5th toe. Small crust L medial malleolus. 

Impressions and Plan:	
Hard to assess control without data. Hopefully her weight loss does not reflect terrible control.
BP much too high. Start Toprol 25 mg qd.
I have no objection to switch to simvastatin from atorvastatin for  cost reasons, but she must check with the transplant MDs re: this switch because of Neoral interaction with statins.
Her chest pain does not sound particularly cardiac but will ask Dr. Dotson whether he wants any further evaluation. 
MUST     see Dr. Aragon, see transplant MD. Make these appointments for her today.
Will get barium swallow because of her dysphagia - ? disorganized esophageal contractions; consider manometry with Dr. Quam.
A1c, Electrolytes, BUN/Creatinine, Ca, P, A/G, 25-(OH) vitamin D, PTH, CBC, urinalysis. Has already taken her Neoral today.
Fasting lipids another day.
Stool guaiacs. Has not done them.
