RE:  Urania Yerger
     MR #583-48-90-0

Dear Dr. Dillon:

I had the pleasure of seeing Urania Yerger today in Titonka Care Center in
follow-up of her coronary artery disease (CABG 10/78) and heart failure.  At her last visit her
heart failure had improved, but she still was hypertensive.  We increased both her Losartan and
her Toprol dosing.  Today her blood pressure is substantially improved.  She has generally been
feeling well.  She has continued to walk outside the home with her daughters, going shopping. 
She denies orthopnea or PND.  She has had stable ankle edema.  

Her current medications are aspirin 325 mg PO q. day, Lasix 40 mg PO q. day, Glipizide 10 mg
PO q. day, Losartan 100 mg PO q. day, Toprol XL 100 mg PO q. day, Simvastatin 10 mg PO q.
day, Avandia, and multivitamins.

On physical examination, her blood pressure today is 130/60.  Her heart rate is in the high 60s. 
She is comfortable seated on the examination table.  Her jugular venous pressure is less than 8. 
Her chest examination has a few coarse crackles at the bases.  Cardiac examination reveals a
non-displaced PMI with normal intensity S1 and S2.  She has a grade II/VI holosystolic murmur
at the apex and a grade II crescendo/decrescendo systolic murmur at the right upper sternal
border.  She has 1 - 2+ edema of both lower extremities and they are warm to touch.

Her ECG reveals sinus rhythm at 68 beats per minute, normal axis and intervals.  There are
nonspecific ST abnormalities.

Overall, Ms. Yerger has improved significantly with better control of her blood pressure.  She
has signs of very mild volume overload on examination, with preserved perfusion.  We elected
to maintain her present dosing, but discussed increasing her dose to 40 mg PO q. a.m. and 20 mg
PO q. p.m. should her lower extremity edema increase or her weight rise.

I look forward to seeing her again in approximately six months.  It was a pleasure being involved
in her care.  Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions.

Sincerely yours,



Vaughn A. Xander, M.D.
