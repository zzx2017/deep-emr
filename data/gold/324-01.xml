This patient was seen with Dr. Russell, medicine resident.  The 
chief complaint, history of presenting illness, past medical 
history, medications, allergies, social history, family history and 
review of systems are as noted by Dr. Russell on the record, and 
were reviewed with her and with the patient. 
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chills, temperature to 104 degrees. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Briefly, this is a 56 year old 
man status post renal transplant, who was recently admitted to a 
hospital for rising creatinine.  Tests showed that he had 
cyclosporine toxicity of his graft and cyclosporine was reduced. 
He was discharged home yesterday.  This was confirmed by biopsy. 
He was fine overnight, but then had some chills this morning, and 
presented to the Emergency Department with a temperature of 104 
degrees. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Is as noted by Dr. Russell on the record 
and basically does not identify a source of infection.  The chest 
is clear to auscultation.  The abdomen is soft with the exception 
of some tenderness over his graft site.  The wound site was 
apparently inspected by the admitting team and was not found to 
show any evidence of infection. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Laboratory studies are still pending. 
Cultures were obtained of both blood and urine. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Fevers, status post renal transplant. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  Disposition - 
admission.  Condition satisfactory.  The primary physician, Dr. 
Oviedo, was notified.
