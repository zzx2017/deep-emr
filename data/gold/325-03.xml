Microbiology:

NA



Radiology:

CXRAY:

Interstitial pulmonary edema, improved from the previous

examination.



EKG: Resolution of the previously Nov-2078 present ST Elevations in V1-V2; LVH

	

Assessment/Plan:

 51 yo F with hx of diastolc dysfunction and recent admission with flash pul edema in the setting of elevated BP, p/w similar symptoms, i.e. acute CHF in setting of severe HTN, no troponin leak, no new ischemic EKG changes



1.CARDS

-Serial EKG's

-Cardiac monitor, telemetry

- Serial Markers

-ASA, Lopressor

-BP ctrl with ACE-I & B-blocker, aiming for SBP goal of 140's-160's for overnight  (BP had been as high as 220's)

-Lipitor; Check fasting lipids   

-Lasix as needed; Strict I/O's, qd wt's

-No need for ECHO or Adenosine-MIBI on this admission given no new EKG changes 

 

2. HTN:

- seems to be well controlled at this time

- if becomes difficult to control will titrate BB up and consider affing another agent 

- may need to be worked up for 2/2 cause of HTN, such as RAS



3. Hx of med noncompliance:  

- will need repetitive reinforcement re importance of adherence to medical regimen

- will discuss potential benefit from being plugged into the CHF clinic

- consider nutrition consult

 

4. Anemia

-Guaiac all stools; 

- Resend iron studies, peripheral smear, retic count, folic acid, B12

- Consider transfusing idf HCT < 30



5. FEN: Low Sodium, Low Cholesterol, Low Fat Diet; Replete lytes as needed



6. Prophylaxis: 

Nexium
