	CARDIOLOGY
	

	BAPTIST MEMORIAL HOSPITAL
	


	Reason for visit:
   coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, history of syncope


	Interval History:
   Mr. Shepherd is a 79 year old man with coronary artery disease, hypertension, diabetes mellitus type 2, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and peripheral vascular disease who was admitted to the medicine service in June, 2094, for syncope and now returns for cardiology followup.  

To summarize, in June, the patient was admitted after experiencing several syncopal episodes.  They were associated with a prodrome of lightheadedness and weakness that sometimes occurred with positional changes and at other times at rest.  He denied associated chest pain, palpitations, diaphoresis, vertigo, focal neurologic weakness, dysphagia, diplopia or blurry vision occur during the episodes. These spells lasted about 4-5 minutes and there were no incontinence, post-ictal symptoms, or tonic-clonic movements.   

His workup included a surface echocardiogram that showed an ejection fraction of 59% but with inferior wall motion abnormalities.  A subsequent adenosine MIBI showed mild inferolateral ischemia and a cardiac catheterization showed 40% ostial RCA disease and a 75% lesion in a small diameter distal PLV.  The culprit lesion was felt to be non-intervenable and the patient was started on medical therapy.  During his admission, his telemetry showed a twelve beat run of non-sustained ventricular tachycardia and so the electrophysiology service was called.  He underwent an electrophysiology study which was nondiagnostic and a REVEAL monitor was implanted.  Prior to his discharge, the patient exhibited features of depression with psychotic features and he was ultimately transferred to the in-patient psychiatry unit for about four weeks. 

Today, he presents with no acute complaints.  He denies chest pain, dyspnea, or palpitations.  He   s had no further fainting spells and reports that his last REVEAL interrogation was unremarkable.  His claudication is at his baseline.  He walks at a mall for 30 minutes to 1 hour before he experiences a "tired" sensation in both legs.  He is followed in the vascular clinic at the FHV medical center.  Also of note, he underwent a repair of a right inguinal hernia in October of 2094 by Dr. Small without complications.

	Assessment and plan:
   79 year old man with known coronary artery disease and risk factors of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, carotid disease, and PVD who has a history of syncope.  He's had no recent episodes and is currently being monitored via a REVEAL monitor.  He is on medical therapy for coronary artery disease.  

Problem list:
1. Syncope - no recent episodes, being monitored with implanted loop recorder

2. Coronary artery disease in RCA and distal PLV on medical therapy
 - aspirin 325
 - lisinopril 40
 - toprol XL 100
 - zocor 80 (last LDL 51)

3. peripheral vascular disease
 - pletal (last echo EF normal)
 - statins
 - followed in vascular clinic at the FHV

4. mild lower extremity edema, no evidence of JVD. Consider lasix if worsening. 

Other problems:
Diabetes mellitus, type 2
Hypertension
Hyperlipidemia
BPH
Glaucoma
Ventral hernia
Depression

Return to care in 6 months or sooner if problems arise.
Pt seen and examined with Dr. Nuvia Nadeau.
