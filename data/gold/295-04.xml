History and Physical

________________________________________________________________________


Attending: Godfrey, Kelley
Fellow: Godfrey, Stanley
Junior: Orosco, Vincent I.
  
Patient: Vieira, Nathan B.
MRN: 0666729
Date: 3/8/2081


HPI: This is a 74 y.o. M with h.o CAD and PVD s/p bilateral lower extremity bypass grafting procedures complicated by a thrombus in the L side of the iliac portion of the graft for which he has been on coumadin. In anticipation for a follow-up cardiac catheterization (recent episodes of shortness of breath), his coumadin was held since Thursday (3/6/2081). Then on 3/7/2081, he was noted by medical staff to have a slightly cool L lower extremity. The patient states that it has felt this way with some intermittent pain at rest for the last several weeks. He complained of both numbness and pain, and he was started on a heparin drip when his INR fell to less than 2.0. Dr. Atwood who did his initial operation was contacted and he was arranged for transfer to RCH. He arrives today (3/8/2081) on a heparin drip.



PHMx: 


DM (insulin-dependent)
CAD (recent echo showed EF 55-60% but inferior wall infarct in 9/2080; stress test in 11/2080 showed no reversible ischemia)
PVD
Bladder atony
Psoriasis
HTN
HL


PSHx: 


R femoral to below-knee popliteal bypass graft with 6-mm PTFE ring (2/2078)

Laboratory Studies: Pending


Imaging: CXR pending


EKG: Pending


Impression: 74 y.o. M with HTN, PVD, HL, DM who presents several days after stopping coumadin for a planned cardiac catheterization with cold, pulseless LLE consistent with acute on chronic thrombosis of L femoral to below-the-knee bypass graft.
