Dear Jac:
 
I saw your patient Kenneth Umstead in the Cardiology Office today and
he feels he has actually improved.  His primary limitation had been
his claudication, but he feels that he can walk better now than in
the past.  We had a repeat evaluation of his segmental leg pressure
and volumes, and these actually were unchanged from a prior study
two years ago.  The post volume recordings were normal in each leg. 
Systolic pressure gradients were present in the right leg
consistent with mild anterior tibial/dorsalis pedis disease.  No
systolic pressure gradients were found in the left leg.  These were
unchanged from January, 2072.  Mr. Umstead feels that he can be more
physically active and is less limited.
 
His current medical regimen includes Metoprolol 50 mg b.i.d.,
Nifedipine XL 60 mg q.d., and Lasix 20 mg q.d.
 
Of note, in October, 2073, he was found by colonoscopy to have four
polyps which were removed.  Apparently, no malignant cells were
seen in the pathologic specimens.
 
On exam, he is comfortable with a blood pressure of 122/68, heart
rate 63 and regular, weight 205 lbs.  HEENT unremarkable.  Chest
was clear.  Cardiac exam showed no jugular venous distention at 30
degrees, PMI is normal.  S1 and S2 normal but physiologically
split.  There was an S4 and a I/VI systolic ejection murmur at the
lower left sternal border.  Abdominal exam was unremarkable. 
Extremities show no edema or cyanosis.
 
His resting 12 lead EKG demonstrates normal sinus rhythm, left axis
deviation, and persisting X waves across the precordium consistent
with his left anterior hemiblock.
 
I think Mr. Umstead is doing quite well.  He asked that I see him
again in six months for routine re-evaluation, and I would be happy
to do so. If any problems develop in the interim please don't
hesitate to contact me.  Thank you for allowing me to participate
in his care.
