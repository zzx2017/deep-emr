The estimated ejection fraction is 55-60%. There are no regional wall motion abnormalities.  The aortic valve appears to be a well seated bioprosthetic valve with normal function (21 mm Perimount ThermaFix by clinical record). The peak antegrade aortic valve velocity is 3.25 m/s. The peak instantaneous aortic valve gradient is 42.1 mmHg. The mean aortic valve gradient is 23.0 mmHg. There is trivial aortic insufficiency.  Mitral Valve: The mitral valve is mildly diffusely thickened. There is moderate to severe mitral regurgitation with a central jet.Type:  Chest 2 ViewsDate/Time:  02/12/2081 21:02     Lungs: The lung volumes are low and decrease sensitivity and specificity for pathology.  There is prominence of the interstitium,   which could represent very mild interstitial edema.  There is no focal air space opacity to suggest pneumonia.           Pleura:  There is no pleural effusion or pneumothorax.           Heart and mediastinum:   The cardiac silhouette is within normal limits in size.  Aortic valve prosthesis is noted.           Bones:  There are mild degenerative changes of the bony thorax.           Contrast is noted in the bowel from prior procedure.           IMPRESSION:      Possible very mild interstitial edema.  No evidence of focal pneumonia.
