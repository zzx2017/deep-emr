                     MEC EMERGENCY DEPT VISIT
 
OLIVIER,CHRISTINE   652-33-21-5                     VISIT DATE: 10/05/75
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Chest pain. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The resident's note was reviewed, 
and the patient seen and examined on arrival.  This is a 
65-year-old female status post multiple angioplasties and stent 
placement.  She had recurrence of her typical angina at home, took 
three nitroglycerin with minimal relief, and activated the 911 
system.  Her pre-hospital electrocardiogram shows a small amount of 
ST depression, perhaps 1 mm, and flattening V3-V6.  This is 
comparable to a previous electrocardiogram in October, which may 
have been her most recent presentation with ischemia.  She was 
given aspirin and nitroglycerin, and continued to have pain in the 
Emergency Department.  The total duration of pain was approximately 
two hours. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her vital signs remained stable. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  Her initial enzymes were flat. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  She is being taken to the Cardiac 
Catheterization Laboratory for an urgent study to rule out acute 
coronary syndrome. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Rule out unstable angina. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  The patient is 
taken to the Cardiac Catheterization Laboratory.  The condition at 
the time of this dictation is favorable.
