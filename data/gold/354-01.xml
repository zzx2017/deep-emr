EDVISIT^11289501^FAY, BROOK^9/18/2094^XAYSANA, YUSEF

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient and the resident, Dr. Vanburen.  Please see his note for

full details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  A 67-year-old female who presents to

triage complaining of substernal chest pain, diaphoretic.  Triage

note states that she is complaining of substernal chest pain

radiating to the neck with this and diaphoresis.  She is cool and

pale.  Her triage vital signs showed pulse of 148, up to 180s. 

She was tachypneic.  Her blood pressure was unobtainable and her

sats were 90% on room air.  She is hypoxic.  She was afebrile,

temperature 96.  She was immediately brought back to room.  At

that time, she complained of palpitations, diaphoresis, and chest

pain since 10 p.m.  She has had no history of an MI.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  She does have history of hypertension,

diabetes, and hypercholesterolemia.

SOCIAL HISTORY:  She denies any tobacco or IV drugs or any other

drugs.  She lives with her family who is at her bedside.

PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  She has had bilateral tubal ligation.

REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Currently, chest pain, palpitations,

diaphoresis, and shortness of breath.  Otherwise, all systems are

negative.

MEDICATIONS:  She is on metformin and Lipitor.

ALLERGIES:  She has no known drug allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  She is awake, alert, in moderate distress.

 She is tachycardic to 180 in the monitor.  Her blood pressure is

not able to be obtained at this time.  Her saturations are 100%

on room air, normal interpretation.  She is alert, awake and

oriented, follows commands.  Her head is atraumatic.  Her pharynx

is normal.  Her neck is supple and nontender.  She is in no

respiratory distress with normal breath sounds.  Her heart is

tachycardic with a narrow complex tachycardia on monitor.  Her

abdomen is soft and nontender.  Her skin is intact but

diaphoretic.  Extremities are without pedal edema.  She is

oriented x3 with no cranial nerve and no motor or sensory

deficits.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  She was placed on a monitor, EKG

and received oxygen as well with this.  She was explained that

she was going to receive adenosine 6 mg and this did break her

off from her SVT.  I was present during this time.  She had an

EKG that then transformed to normal sinus rhythm at 91 with an

incomplete right bundle-branch block with no previous to compare.

 She received aspirin, Lopressor, and nitroglycerin and remained

hemodynamically stable throughout her ED stay.  For her

tachycardia and chest pain, we ruled out AFib, complex

tachycardia, pulmonary embolism, and acute coronary syndrome. 

She was admitted for telemetry as well as a cardiac rule out. 

Her white count was 12 and her hematocrit was 42.  BUN 29 and

creatinine 1.2.  The d-dimer was negative.  Troponin was

negative.  Her chest x-ray was negative.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

1.  SVT.

2.  Chest pain, rule out acute coronary syndrome.

3.  Abnormal EKG.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  20 minutes.
