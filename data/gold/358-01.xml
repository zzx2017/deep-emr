CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Ms. Greenwood comes in to urgent care clinic for
hives after taking Keflex.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  She is a 47-year-old woman with
chronic hydradenitis suppurativa since the age of 18 in her left
axilla and her groin.  She has been to the emergency room
multiple times for purulent drainage around her groin.  She has
been given multiple courses of antibiotics including Keflex and
dicloxacillin.  She is planning to have her disease surgically
managed in the next few months.  She most recently presented to
the emergency room on January 7, 2079 with swelling and drainage
of her hydradenitis in her groin.  She was given a prescription
of Keflex.  Shortly after taking the first tablet, she developed
itching in the hands, face, and legs and as well as hives.  She
denied any shortness of breath, difficulty breathing or loss of
consciousness.  She called the emergency room and was instructed
to stop taking Keflex as this was most likely an allergic
reaction.  So now, she is here for follow up from that.  She said
shortly after stopping antibiotic her symptoms of hives and
itchiness have improved very quickly.  She is still complaining
of purulent drainage around her groin.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes.

MEDICATIONS:  Glucotrol, Percocet as needed for pain.

ALLERGIES:  She is allergic to erythromycin and now Keflex.  She
gets hives from both.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her left axilla looks dry.  Her bilateral
groins looks red, swollen tender with some serous as well as some
purulent drainage.  There is no fluctuance that I could feel.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Worsening of her hydradenitis.  Given the
recent allergy to Keflex, we will obviously need to take a
different antibiotic.  She has been on dicloxacillin in the past
with good result.  Despite the 15% cross allergy of dicloxacillin
compared to Keflex, I think dicloxacillin is a good choice for
now.  If this does not work, I think one should consider
clindamycin for treatment.  I will go ahead and give her 14 days
worth of dicloxacillin and I instructing her to notify M.D. if
she develops any allergic reaction to this medicine.  I also gave
her 60 tablets of Percocet as well as renewed her renewed her
prescription of Glucotrol XL 2.5 mg a day.  She should see her
PCP in two weeks.
