			Reason for visit:

   Follow up of CAD s/p CABG adn multiple CV risk factors



			Interval History:

   A 74 yo man with a long history of CAD eventually necessitating CABG in 4/2161.  He has had several chest pain syndromes over the years but, as of late, has been doing quite well in that regard.

His last CV evaluation was an Adenosine PET in 4/63 which showed an EF 46 with anterior and anterolateral flow abnormalites.  These are consistent with his known occluded diagonal (also unbypassed).  His last cath in 6/62 showed patent vein grafts to his OM and to his RCA and a patent but atretic LIMA.  He has an occluded RCA, an 80% OM, and a 60% LAD in addition to the occluded diagonal (fills via OM collaterals).  

He was admitted to Fahey Center in May with syncope associated with bradycardia.  His atenolol was changed to coreg and he has had no difficulties since that time.  He does have a long-standing trifasicular block.

He denies any chest pain, orthopnea, PND, LEE, palpitations, or syncope since that admission.

Someone started him on Niaspan which has been associated with diffuse flushing, itching, and a burning sensation.





			Past medical history:

   CAD with CABG in 4/61, LIMA to LAD, V to RCA PLVB, V to OM  -- he has an unbypassed occluded Diagonal with collaterals from the OM

			Assessment and plan:

   A 74 yo man with multiple chest pain syndromes and CV risk factors associated with CAD and mild LV dysfunction.  His chest pain syndromes have resolved.  He has a long-standing trifasicular block and had what sounds like syncope a few months ago.  This was associated with bradycardia and has resolved with changing him to low dose coreg.

CV risk factor modification remains our primary focus.

Plan.

1. CAD-increase asa to 325 and take at night with niaspan in hopes of lessening side effects.  He needs an ARB, so will try again to get him to take diovan at 80 a day (I gave samples and a Rx).

2. LV dysfunction--we will check a GBPS for EF.

3. DM-followed by Dr. Orton.  Continue to aim for an A1c of 7.0

4. Carotid disease--this seems to be limited to the external carotid, so I don't think any intervention will be necessary.  Continue to Rx risk factors.

5. Lipids-look great today.  Continue as is, but given his past intolerance of and noncompliance with meds, I suspect he will give up the Niaspan soon!  We will try to give asa with it to help with the side effects.

6. HTN--home BPs have been higher too on coreg.  I am trying to get him on an ARB again.  Diovan at 80 a day. He will get f/u labs in one month



f/u 6months
