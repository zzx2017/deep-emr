CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Mr. Noonan is a 69-year-old man who has type
II insulin-requiring diabetes, obesity, hypertension,
dyslipidemia, chronic atrial fibrillation, degenerative
osteoarthritis and diabetic neuropathy.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  He comes today complaining of one
week with mild chest pain not irradiated to the head, to jaw or
the arm, but with very mild shortness of breath.  He denies
nausea, vomiting or sweatiness.

CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Protonix 40 mg p.o. b.i.d., verapamil SR
190 mg q.d., Lasix 20 mg p.o. q.d., Neurontin 900 mg in the
morning 900 mg at noon and 300 mg at night, Lipitor 10 mg q.d.,
Zestril 10 mg q.d., Glucophage 1000 mg twice a day, and 75/25
insulin 40 units in the morning and 40 in the evening, Tylenol
with Codeine p.r.n. for severe pain and Coumadin 3 mg alternating
with 4.5 mg.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The blood pressure today is 120/88 and his
weight is 256 pounds.  The examination of the neck with no lymph
nodes.  He is oriented and in no acute distress.  The cardiac
examination with arrhythmia consistent with atrial fibrillation. 
The lungs with hypoventilation in both bases and no evidence of
acute congestive heart failure.  He has edema that has been
chronic in both extremities.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:  Review of an EKG obtained in August of this
year showed atrial fibrillation with premature ventricular or
apparently conducted complexes, nonspecific T-wave abnormality
probably digitalis effect, abnormal EKG that when compared to the
one in June showed nonspecific T-wave abnormalities that were not
evident at that time and now present in anterior leads.

I have talked to people in the emergency department and he is
being sent right now for an evaluation of possible angina.
