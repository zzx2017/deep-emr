Patient is here for follow-up.



1.  Diabetes.  Continues on both glyburide and Glucophage although recently has been out of glyburide and sugars have been somewhat high.



2.  Hypertension.  Medications changed by either cardiology or the ANRC and now on amlodipine 7.5 mg qd as well as fosinopril 40 mg bid, continues on hydrochlorothiazide as well.  Reports compliance with his regimen.



3.  CAD.  Switched from lovastatin to simvastatin, continues on a baby aspirin a day.  No complaints of any palpitations or chest pain or shortness of breath.



4.  GERD.  Recently started on a proton pump inhibitor for chronic symptoms of heartburn type pain.



There were some confusion regarding patients medications as he gets many of his medications from the ANRC and I had been on aware of some of the medication changes that have been made recently.  Has stated above no longer on verapamil but now on amlodipine, changed to simvastatin.  He brought in a list of all his medications and dosage adjustments were made to the LMR medication list.

Assessment and Plan



1.  Diabetes.  Has been out of medication any is given a new prescription for his glyburide which he is now taking 10 mg bid.  Continuing on Glucophage.  Will check a fasting glucose, urine for microalbumin and HgbA1c just before his next appointment.



2.  Hypertension.  Blood pressure initially elevated today but on subsequent reading within normal limits.  Continue current regimen but will monitor.  Check BUN and creatinine and potassium with next phlebotomy.



3.  CAD.  Continue current regimen, check lipid profile just before next visit.  Also will check LFTs.



I will see him for follow-up in two months.
