Dear Dr. Nall:


It was a pleasure to see Nick Hall again in the Cardiology clinic at Wytheville South Hospital in followup of his post myocardial infarction care.  As you are well aware, he has many coronary risk factors.  He is a 55-year-old gentleman with past history Hodgkin's disease, status post mantle radiation in the early 2070s and left upper lobe lobectomy in 2094 for early stage squamous cell lung cancer that was complicated by VT/VF arrest.  He has history of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, as well as overweight.  He does not have a former history of type 2 diabetes, but on recent screening, his hemoglobin A1c has been elevated at 8%.  His prior history of coronary artery disease dates back to 2087 and 2090 when he had non-ST elevation MI and coronary interventions to his LAD and RCA.  He has subsequently had a VT/VF arrest during his lobectomy in 2094, which required emergent coronary angiographic resuscitation where he was found to have a massive thrombus throughout his right coronary artery that required thrombectomy and POBA with good results.  He remarkably has had a preserved LV function after all of these infarctions with only some basal inferoposterior hypokinesis.  In 01/2095, he developed recurrent exertional and then unstable angina, presented to Wytheville Sanitarium Hospital Emergency where he was considered to be high risk acute coronary artery syndrome with positive troponins and proceeded to the catheterization clinic where he again had proximal LAD and RCA occlusions, both which were intervened with drug-eluting Cypher stents with good results.  Since then, he has been doing well and has been instructed to be on double dose clopidogrel 150 mg lifelong and full dose aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily lifelong.


We see him in followup today, and again, he has no limitations in his exertional capacity.  Work has been tough in consulting and he is now working 2 jobs including overnight shifts, which is strenuous at times.  He is looking for work as a dog walker and will find out soon whether he can quit his evening jobs and will be able to increase his exercise capacity such that he will be doing more walking with that job.  He has no chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, presyncope, or syncope with exertion.  He has no signs or symptoms of heart failure.  He has been taking his blood pressures at home, which range at about 126/81 to 142/92 with an average of 135/85.  His heart rates have been in 50s-70s.  He has had no side effects to his medications.  He is not smoking and he is not drinking alcohol.  He says that he walks for 2-3 miles when the weather is nice, but given that it has been a harsh winter, he has not been doing this often.


His current medications, aspirin 325 mg p.o. daily, clopidogrel 150 mg p.o. daily, atorvastatin 80 mg p.o. daily, levothyroxine 125 mcg p.o. daily, and metoprolol sustained release 200 mg p.o. b.i.d.


Physical Examination: Nick looked well.  His weight was 232 pounds, his blood pressure was 153/89 in the right arm and 150/95 in the left arm with a large cuff, and his heart rate was 69 and regular.  His head and neck exam revealed normal jugular venous pressure and normal carotid upstroke and contour.  There are no bruits.  His chest is clear to auscultation.  He was not clubbed.  His cardiovascular exam revealed a normal left apex and normal S1 and S2 with no additional gallops, rubs, or murmurs.  He had no peripheral edema.  His abdomen was soft and nontender with no organomegaly.  His pulses were palpable 2+ throughout.


EKG:  Normal sinus rhythm, heart rate 61, minimal voltage criteria for LVH and left atrial enlargement.  Prior inferior Q-wave MI.


Lab values from today:  His electrolyte panel was notable for sodium 144, potassium 4.1, chloride 107, bicarb 28, creatinine 1, urea 16, normal calcium, normal LFTs, and normal CK level.  TSH was also normal.  Hemoglobin A1c was elevated at 6.8%.


Lipid levels:  Total cholesterol 164, TG 145, HDL 33, LDL 102.


Echocardiogram from last year revealed normal LV ejection fraction of 60%-65%.  Mild left atrial enlargement, no LVH.


Impression:  Nick is still borderline hypertensive, and in the setting of having survived multiple myocardial infarctions, Hodgkin lymphoma and now declaring himself as potential glucose intolerant and early diabetic, I think it is time to start an ACE inhibitor as we have discussed previously.  We started him on ramipril 2.5 mg today and he will increase that to 5 mg a day after tolerating it for 2 weeks.  He will take his blood pressures at home few times a week.  To simplify and decrease his beta-blocker regimen we switched to atenolol 100mg daily today.  We also discussed increasing his lipid management by adding niacin again starting at 500 mg extended release for a month and then he will increase that to 1 g a day.  He was cautioned on the adverse potential reactions of facial flushing and headache and he was instructed to take his aspirin 325 about 30 minute prior to his niacin to minimize these potential side effects.


With regards to his coronary artery disease, all this time we have assumed that his atherosclerosis has been secondary to high dose radiation exposure when he was a child.  Nevertheless, Dr. Turner had a great suggestion that we screen him for quantitative platelet function inhibition, given we recently started performing this test at WSH and previously had recurrence on normal strength doses of clopidogrel and aspirin.  The results may not changes our current management strategy, but it may give us insight into his premature CAD etiology, particularly coronary artery thrombus, as well as play a future role in familial screening.  To that end, we have requested light transmission aggregometry for platelet function inhibition.  We have also requested a thrombophilia workup, including factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene mutation, protein C and S levels, antithrombin level and homocysteine and CRP today.


Otherwise, I believe Nick is doing well.  We will see him again in 6 months' time with follow up on these studies.  If by then he still has evidence of diabetes, and trouble losing weight, we will refer him to our nutritionist for counseling and refer him to hadley memorial hospital.  He may need a structured monitored exercise program in order to help improve his exercise capacity.  


This patient was discussed with Dr. Turner in clinic.


Yours sincerely,
