CC:  73 yo woman admitted with recurrent hypotension preventing hemodialysis



HPI:  Putting together Ms. Falon's story from her personal history, she has had type 2 diabetes for many years and is now suffering from many of the complications of that disease, including retinopathy, neuropathy and nephropathy. This lead to ESRD and hemodialysis starting 18 months ago, using a left forearm AV fistula that recently required catheter based intervention after clogging for a second time. Also related, at least in part, to her diabetic disease is coronary artery disease leading to a non-ST elevation MI in December 2074. Since then she has had bouts of what appears to be her anginal equivalent- left ear pain and a sense of fullness in her lower chest that occur at rest and are fleeting, going away before she has time to try a SLTNG. In addition, Ms. Fallon states that her blood pressures have run much lower, on occasion preventing the removal of fluid during dialysis, which leaves her edematous and more fatigued than normal. She is on a STTh HD schedule, but came to the EW four nights ago with hypotension in the setting of HD. She did not go to HD today, as her SBP was again too low.  Using a home machine, Ms. Fallon recorded SBPs in the 80's and complains of frequent periods of dizziness, especially when getting up from the seated position. She is unable to lie flat 2/2 to orthopnea. She denies recent fevers, chills, SOB or chest pain. Lower extremity swelling continues to be a problem and she is complaining of left heel pain.



PMH: ESRD as a result of DM on HD, DM related retinopathy/neuropathy; h/o infected tunneled catheter; hyperparathyroidism; HTN in the past; CAD s/p NSTEMI 12/74, echo in Jan 2074 showed EF 52%; CHF;  PVD with RLE ulcer followed by Dr. Archer; h/o  GI bleed with negative upper endoscopy , pending colonoscopy, umbilical and hiatal hernia, cervical CA 6 years ago s/p hysterectomy; gout; benign breast tumor; h/o DVT s/p filter placement; h/ hypercalcemia, depression



PSH: TAH 6 years ago; left arm AV fistula s/p thrombectomy x 2, most recently one week ago



Medications: Allopurinol 200 po qd, Mevacor 20 po qd, Quinine 350 po BID, Concerta 3 tabs qd, Colace, Pericolace, Tylenol #3 prn, Nephrocaps 1 tab po qd, ASA 81 po qd, Lantus insulin 50 units qam, Tums 1 tab po tid with meals

Alternative meds: None

Allergies: MSO4 cause SOB; Novocaine causes seizure



Family history: Non-contributory



Social history: Lives at home with husband of 34 years, two children from previous marriage live in the area, has grandchildren. Used to work in construction.



Risks: Never use tobacco, rarely used alcohol, no injection drug use



Review of systems: (+) some vaginal blood spotting recently. No recent HA, nausea, vomiting, fevers, chills, cough, sputum production, diarrhea, melena, hematochezia, dysuria, abdominal pain.



PE: Elderly, pale woman in NAD. T 97.7 degrees, BP 117/62, HR 84, RR 24, Sat 99% on RA. HEENT: NC,ST, PERRL, EOMI, anicteric, non-injected, arcus senilis no oto/rhinorrhea, oral mucosa moist, no cervical LAD or tenderness, no thyromegaly, neck supple, no supraclavicular LAD or bruits. HEART- RRR, Nl S1 and S2, no S3, S4 or murmur. PULM- CTA bilaterally with moderate to good BS bilaterally, no wheeze, rales or rhonchi. ABD- soft, NT, ND, BS+, reducible herniano HSM or masses, no aortic, hepatic or renal bruits. EXT- Bilateral brawny edema of LE. SKIN- changes if chronic venous statis of LE with tender shallow fissure of left heel. NEURO- A/O x 3, conversant, well-formed sentences, appropriate although somewhat flat, but laughed occasionally, CN 2-12 intact, visual fields intact bilaterally, DTRs 1+ and symmetric in triceps, biceps, quads and achilles, strength 4/5 bilateral U and LE



Data: Na 136, K 5.6, Cl 96, HCO3 29, BUN 69, Cr 10.2, Glu 96, Ca 9.3, PO4 6.9, Mg 2.0, Alb 2.9; WBC 12.2 no diff, HCT 32.7, PLT 247; PT 13.5, PTT 24



ECG: NSR with occasional ectopy, RBBB and 1st degree AV block, no e/o ischemia or infarction



Imaging:  CXR today shows pulmonary venous hypertension with interstitial edema and small pleural effusions bilaterally. Patchy opacity at the left lung base most likely represents alveolar edema or atelectasis.



CODE status: Unknown



Focused problem list:  Hypotension limiting hemodialysis s/p MI 3 months ago, DM, neuropathy, depression



A/P: 73 year old woman with likely autonomic instability resulting from long-standing diabetes. In order to effectively counter the level of hypotension that she experiences after HD, she may benefit from interventions that will raise the systemic BP.



1)	Blood pressure

-   Adenosine-stress MIBI today

-	If the above is OK, plant to start midodrine 5 mg po tid



2)	Renal failure

-   Check lytes in AM

-	To HD in AM

-	Already received kayexalate in EW tonight

-	Increase Tums to 2 tabs po tid with meals for hyperphosphatemia



3)	Vaginal spotting

-   Pt has a gynecologist here at RH, will contact re: imaging vs other, esp in setting of h/o cervical CA

-	HCT stable
