CHIEF COMPLAINT:  Follow-up laboratory testing.



HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient is a 56-year-old white

man who I have not seen since November of 2088.  Approximately

four weeks ago, he started noting visual changes.  He saw colored

spots floating in his visual field.  He has been noting some

decreased depth perception and visual acuity.  At the same time,

he has been getting throbbing unilateral headaches, which he

believes were migraines.  He saw an ophthalmologist at Mediquik who told him that his eye exam was within normal limits.

 He was then referred to Dr. Gill for neurologic evaluation. 

Dr. Gill did not note any significant neurologic deficits. 

However, during his workup, he did check a hemoglobin A1c, which

came back at 10.2.  Of note, the last time I saw the patient, I

had sent him a letter stating that his glucose was slightly

elevated and asking him to return for a fasting glucose.  He

never returned for that testing.



PAST MEDICAL HISTORY: Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia,

obesity, and gout.



MEDICATIONS:  HCTZ 50 mg p.o. q.d.,  Atenolol 50 mg p.o. b.i.d.,

allopurinol 300 mg p.o. q.d.



ALLERGIES:  No known drug allergies.



FAMILY HISTORY:  Negative for diabetes but positive for kidney

failure.  This is thought to be due to glomerulonephritis.



SOCIAL HISTORY:  He is a Graphic Arts Technician in Oconto.  He is

currently on a leave of absence from work.  He is a nonsmoker.



REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  He believes that he has lost some weight over

the past four weeks but cannot quantify the amount.  He has been

noting anxiety symptoms, increased urinary frequency, and

nocturia.  Otherwise, constitutional, HEENT, cardiac,

respiratory, GI, GU, musculoskeletal, neurologic, and

dermatologic are negative.



PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  In general, he is a pleasant obese white

man in no acute distress.  Vitals: Blood pressure 134/90, pulse

66 and regular, and weight 249 pounds.  HEENT:  PERRL, EOMI,

anicteric sclerae.  Clear oropharynx with dry mucous membranes. 

Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy, no thyromegaly.  Chest: 

CTA&P bilaterally.  Heart: RRR, no MRG.  Abdomen:  Obese, soft,

NT/ND, NABS, no HSM.  Extremities:  No CCE.  Neuro:  A&O x 3, 2+

DTRs bilaterally.



LABORATORY DATA: EKG shows normal sinus rhythm at 73 beats per

minute, normal axis and intervals, no ST-T-wave changes.



ASSESSMENT AND PLAN:

1.   Diabetes.  The patient was advised that his laboratory

testing and symptoms are all consistent with adult-onset

diabetes.  Given the severity of his symptoms, I have elected to

start him on metformin 500 mg p.o. q.d.  Use and side effects

were reviewed.  He will have Chem-7, urinary microalbumin and

fasting lipid profile checked today.  Unfortunately, he was not

actually fasting.  He will also be referred to Gretchen Drew and

Bertha Ely for further diabetic and nutritional education. 

He will be started on lisinopril instead of  HCTZ.  He is asked

to return in six weeks for follow up of his blood pressure.  He

was advised that his visual changes are likely due to lens

swelling due to the uncontrolled diabetes.  I assume that this

will resolve as the blood sugars come under better control.  He

was given a written note regarding leave of absence from his job

until his symptoms clear.

2.  Migraines.  The patient does sound as if he is also having

migraines.  We will address this at future visits.
