  Dear Dr. Yingling:

  

  Thank you for referring your patient, Imogene Adler,

  for her problem of coronary ischemia.  As you know, Ms.

  Adler is a 49 year old woman with four years of

  essential hypertension and mild dyslipidemia who is

  postmenopausal and has noticed increasing symptoms of chest

  tightness associated with exertion.  A stress MIBI SPECT

  study ordered by you demonstrated inferolateral mid and

  basal inferior ischemia consistent with a left circumflex

  distribution.  The details of the study include an exercise

  protocol for which the patient exercised for 7 minutes and

  15 seconds for 8.9 mets, with an increase in heart rate from

  74 to 159 (which is 94% of predicted peak heart rate), and

  increase in blood pressure from 134/80 to 210/80 (with a

  rate pressure product of 33,390).  The test was stopped due

  to fatigue and moderately severe chest pain.  EKG

  demonstrated 1.5mm of upsloping depression in II, III, F and

  V4-V5, and there were no noted arrhythmias.  

  

  Her past medical history is otherwise unremarkable and her

  current medications include estrogen, Premarin, Provera, and

  verapamil 240mg q.d.  A recent lipid panel demonstrated a

  total cholesterol of 203, LDL of 142, and an HDL of 39.

  

  On physical examination, she is comfortable, well appearing

  woman with a weight of 186 pounds, pulse 68 beats per minute

  and regular, blood pressure 140/82 in the left arm.  Jugular

  venous pressure was approximately 6-8cm of water.  Carotids

  demonstrates normal upstroke with no bruits.  Chest

  examination was clear to auscultation.  Heart examination

  demonstrated a normal S1, positive S4, physiologically split

  S2, no murmurs or rubs.  Abdominal examination was

  unremarkable.  Peripheral examination demonstrated no

  peripheral examination and 2+ bilateral peripheral pulses.  

  

  EKG demonstrated normal sinus rhythm and otherwise normal

  EKG.  

  

  I reviewed the findings suggestive of an obstructive

  coronary lesion in the left circumflex distribution and the

  probability of her having single vessel coronary artery

  disease as the culprit for her chest pain.  We reviewed the

  options which include medical therapy and/or coronary

  angiography and possible angioplasty.  I made no solid

  recommendations for her, but suggested that the angioplasty

  approach was a relatively low risk approach which may lead

  to curing the obstructive lesion as opposed to medical

  therapy, which would also be a well supported decision, and

  I reviewed the evidence to suggest medical treatment of

  single vessel disease does not shorten one's life span and

  only affects the quality of life depending on the symptom

  tolerance.  She and her husband are going to reflect on

  these recommendations and get back to me by the end of the

  week.  If she does decide to undergo coronary angiography

  and possible angioplasty, we will schedule her immediately

  in Cardiology.

  

  I have scheduled follow-up in one month regardless to see

  her in the office.  Please do not hesitate to contact me if

  I can be of any further assistance.

  

  With warm regards,
