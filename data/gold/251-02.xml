Reason for Visit:  

taxotere weekly chemo



Diagnosis/Treatment Summary: 

Stage IVB (axillary and retroperitoneal LN and very large celiac axis LN mass) 

s/p XRT to esophagus

Renal vein thrombus on Coumadin 



History:  Patient is a 72 year old man who began having dysphagia 6/83.  On 8/01/83 he was scheduled for a Colonoscopy, so his PCP suggested he have an UGI Endoscopy at the same time.  The Colonoscopy demonstrated Diverticulosis and the UGI Endoscopy demonstrated a partially obstructing esophageal/gastric cardia tumor which was biopsied.  Pathology revealed moderately to poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma.  On 8/10/83 an Abd and Pelvic CT were done showing:  marked thickening of the wall of the distal esophagus (35-40cm by endoscopy - partial obstruction and circumferential) extending into the gastric cardia, consistent with biopsy proven adenocarcinoma. Also felt to be bleeding silently so placed on Fe replacement. Also, enlarged gastroepiploic, celiac and aortocaval lymph nodes consistent with metastatic disease.  On 8/10/83 a Chest CT revealed thickening of the lower esophagus extending into the chest esophageal junction.  This is associated with lymphadenopathy in the (L) axilla, gastrohepatic ligament, celiac axis and retrocrural space.  The appearance is highly suspicious for esophageal cancer and nodal spread.  There is a 3mm nodule adjacent to the (R) major fissure in the lung. PET scan confirmed axillary and abdominal involvement with cancer. The lung nodule was too small for PET to evaluate. 



He remains quite asymptomatic with no weight loss or dysphagia.  He denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or constipation.  He has mild intermittant esophageal pain, usually after eating.  No bleeding. He does complain of baseline DOE, although no SOB at rest. He is fatigued.  Dizziness is improved with decrease in hypertension meds



Problems/PMH:

Repair of Zenker's diverticulum in 2080

Aterial stent was placed in the mid LAD in 4/80

Never smoked

Rare ETOH- 6 beers per year

Aerospace engineer for 40 years

No family history of cancer

Here with sister.

Data (laboratory and radiographs) 

Results



01/07/2084 BUN 14,  CRE 1.3



01/07/2084 WBC 4.5,  RBC 4.72,  HGB 10.7 (L),  HCT 34.0 (L),  MCV 72 (L),  MCH 22.7 (L),  MCHC 31.5,  PLT 131 (L)



01/07/2084 ANEUT 3.52,  ALYMP 0.57 (L),  AMONS 0.31,  AEOSN 0.05 (L),  ABASOP 0.01







Assessment and Plan:



72 year old man with Stage IVB metastatic esophageal cancer s/p XRT with growing LN outside the field of radiation. Doing great.

Renal vein thrombosis- continue same coumadin regimen

Anemia, and DOE- continue procrit

Consider head MRI if dizziness continues after hypotension and anemia are resolved

Cycle 3, Week 3 of taxotere chemotherapy today. Scans this week

RTC in one week for results and plan
