Vascular Surgery Admission Note



Patient Name:  Jain, Oliver

MRN:  9628518 

Date and Time: 8/25/33 2:40PM

Attending: Dr. Uselton

Fellow: Dr. Joshi

Resident: Dr. Ray-Gallegos

Night Float: Dr. Xayachack

PA: Brandi Xayasane, PA-C



cc: RLE graft stenosis



HPI: Mr. Jain is a 67 year old male with a h/o DM, HTN, HL, Chronic Afib, PVD and bilateral popliteal aneurysm s/p R popliteal thrombosis w/ resultant RLE ischemia and dry gangrene of heel, toes and forefoot.  He has since undergone a R SFA to BK popliteal bpg w/ saphenous vein graft and 8mm PTFE w/ angioplasty to the R PTA.  In March of this year he underwent a distal bpg from the R posterior tibial artery to the plantar artery and then a R TMA later that month. His R TMA has healed well since then. He is also s/p L fem-pop bpg to repair his L popliteal aneurysm.  



He saw Dr. Uselton in follow up last week at which time graft surveillance duplex showed normal functioning graft on the left, however on the right he appears to have a high-grade stenosis at the distal aspect of the femoral popliteal graft.  The more distal graft on the right, which is the vein graft to the plantar artery in the foot remains patent.  



He denies recent h/o fevers/chills, N/V, abdominal pain, or neurological sx. He c/o some RLE edema for the past 3 weeks. His PCP put him on a water pill but it had no effect.



He continues on coumadin for graft patentcy. His last dose was Saturday.

TEST TYPE: Bypass Graft Duplex



HISTORY


Diabetes: Yes



REASON FOR STUDY


Surveillance



Graft:-

Summary:   Left superficial femoral - popliteal (below knee) Bypass

Op. Date:  11/17/2132

Surgeon:   



Results:-

          Velocity  Ratio  Stenosis

          --------  -----  --------   

Inflow:    102.0

Proximal:  103.0      1.0  Normal

Mid-graft:  41.0      0.8  Normal

Distal:    133.0      6.0  Severe

Outflow:    57.0      0.4  Normal



ABI:      




SYMPTOMS



FINDINGS


The inflow (the left  mid superficial femoral artery)  is patent.  The 


proximal anastomosis is widely patent.  The proximal, mid- and distal graft is

  widely patent.  The distal anastomosis terminates in the popliteal artery 


(below the knee)  and demonstrates a significant increase in peak systolic 


velocity, correlating with 50-99% stenosis.  The distal native ( posterior 


tibial artery)  is patent.



IMPRESSION


1. Patent the left mid superficial femoral to popliteal artery (below the 


knee) BPG with &gt;50 % stenosis in the distal anastomosis


2. The mid- distal graft velocities of 41.0  - 22 cm/sec  suggest a 


compromised graft.





CXR-lungs clear, heart size upper limit of normal.





A/P:  67M w/ a h/o HTN, HL, DM, PVD and bilateral popliteal aneursyms s/p L fem-pop bpg; R popliteal thrombosis and subsequent R fem-pop bpg, R PT to plantar bpg and R TMA; presents with stenosis of the distal anastamosis of his femoral popliteal graft on the Right. He will undergo angiogram with possible angioplasty of graft stenosis.   






-Admit to Vascular Surgery-Dr. Uselton

-CXR/ECG
