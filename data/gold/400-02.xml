Cardiac:  Neg X 2


-       Trop T :               
-       CK-MB: 
-       CPK : 


EKG:
80, LVH, LA enlarg, new t-wave inversion in V5/V6 comapred to a wk ago. 


ASSESSMENT &amp; PLAN:


59 yo female with hypertensive emergency, fatigue, and hypokalemia, no other symtomes. EKG with new wave inversion in lateral leads and negative cardiac enzymes. 




1-       Hypertensive Emergency : patient received 2 inch nitropaste on floor with no decrease in BP. 10mg IV hydralizine got her down to the 150s-160s. Goal is around 160-170. Will start Nicardipine PO 20mg TID and Labetolol 300mg PO and titrate up to BP goal.   to maintain goal 
2-       Hypkalemia/fatigue/hypertension: worried about secondary casues of HTN, namely hyperaldo state or liddel syndrom. Will check an 8am ambulating PAC to PRA ratio, will also check a spot urine to plasma K. Will check serum Metanephrine for pheo, and 24 hrs urine for cortisol, lytes, VMA, metanephrines to check for cushings and pheochromoctoma.  Will get a MRA to evaluate for renal artery stenosis. 
2-       Mood disorder: no active hallucination, will continue with Seroquel.
3-       DM: insulin sliding scale, QID finger sticks.
4-       UTI: urine with WBC, ? starting Bactrim DS X3 days. 
5-       Prophy:  Fragmin SC.
