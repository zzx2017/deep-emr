Internal Medicine Intern Admit Note

Pt: Samuel Tuttle

MR: 2793372



Cc: EKG changes 



HPI: 66 y.o. male with pmhx of DM, incr.cholestoral, and autonomic insufficeny admitted for EKG changes. The patient has significant risk factors for CAD of DM, incr. Cholesterol, and h/o htn.  He had a adenosine stress test done in 11/47 which was negative for ischemia (lasting 5min and PDP of 13746). His last echo was done in 4/48 showed an EF of 59% presented to the health clinic with a 3 day hx of worsening L shoulder pain and episodes of diaphoresis. The shoulder pain is chronic and thought to be due to oa, and dm chor.He came to the clinic today for a BP check ( he is often hypotensive and orthostatic) and was noted to have TWI inferiorly and laterally on routine EKG.   He denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting when he went to the e.r. 

In the e.r., his first set of cardiac enzymes was negative, he was also started on heparin IV, and given IV lopressor, and an aspirin. Of note, the patient had a bp up to 182/88. When the patient arrived on the floor he denied any chest pain, nausea, vomiting, diaphoresis. His BP was noted to be 228/105. 2.5 IV lopressor, 12.5 PO lopressor, and nitropaste were given initially to lower bp to 170/75.

Chest x-ray - 

1.  NO EVIDENCE OF PNEUMONIA OR PULMONARY EDEMA.

	2.  CALCIFIED PLEURAL PLAQUES, AS BEFORE.

	3.  A NODULAR OPACITY IN THE RIGHT UPPER LUNG ZONE IS NOW BETTER

	DEFINED THAN IN THE PREVIOUS EXAMINATION.  IN LIGHT OF THE CHANGE

	IN APPEARANCE, CHEST C. T. MAY BE WARRANTED TO EXCLUDE A GROWING

	NEOPLASM.



EKG- from e.r. TWI in II, III, avF, v3-v6. borderline LVH, left atrial enlargement

On admission - flattened TW in II, II,avF, TWI v4, v5



Imp: 66 y.o. male with hx of DM, autonomic instability, incr. Cholesterol presents with new EKG changes.



Plan:

1.C-V

a)	ischemia - r/o MI, first set of cardiac enzymes negative, will get two more sets to r/o. Will monitor for EKG changes. New TWI in inferior and lateral chest leads worrisome in a patient with multiple risk factors. Last stress negative 6 months ago. Will talk with PCP and team in a.m. to discuss the need for stress in asymptomatic patient with recent stress. EKG changes may be secondary to htn strain. Will d/c IV heparin. Cont. po lopressor as long as patient's bp tolerates it. ASA qd. Appreciate input of Dr. Bodnari and will discuss future management.

b)	Pump - last ef 59% pt. Appears euvolemic

c)	Rhythm - no hx of arrythmia, on cardiac monitor/telemetry overnight



2. HTN - pt. Htn when he arrived on floor. Hx of hypotension. Will give low dose lopressor 12.5mg BID as well as nitropaste. Need to be careful of lowering BP too fast. Pt.'s bp unstable in past.  Will hold florinef and proamatine for now



3. DM - hx of retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. Will maintain on home regiman of nph, and cover with iss.



4. Shoulder pain - ultram, PT 



5. Resp - opacity in RUL, may be secondary to old TB. According to radiologist reading it has changed since past x-rays. Asymptomatic. Can be worked up as an outpatient.



6. Prophylaxis - pneumoboots, nexium
