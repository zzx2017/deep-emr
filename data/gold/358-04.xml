 Ms. Greenwood is a 50yo F with DM, HTN, hidradenitis, hyperlipidemia and obesity who presents for routine follow-up.  Since her last visit, she has been to the Windsor Hospital where she was started on "sea kelp" lotion for hidradenitis and was told to bathe in salt water and keep the affected areas moist. No longer taking levofloxacin. She is encouraged about this new treatment. These doctors recommended losing 50 lbs, which could help her condition as well.  Because of this, she has been to see the nutritionist today and is eager to lose 40lb. 

Diabetes: as her sugars have been high, she self increased metformin to BID. Has not noticed any side effects. Would like her sugars checked today.

Social Stressors: her husband will be released from jail in November. She intends to move prior to his release. Still involved with psychiatry and passageways. Uses ativan up to 4 times a day for anxiety. Had her meds confiscated by security at Chariton airport as her PICH last name does not match her drivers license.

Trauma: attacked by her cat 5 days ago on her left wrist--using topical antibiotics obtained at Montgomery Infirmary ED.

SHx: volunteering for Computer Sciences Corporation and enjoying the work. Smoking has decreased to 4 per day. Home phone # 249-007-9762
