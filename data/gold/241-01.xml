RE:  Christine Olivier
     MR #652-33-21-5
 
Dear Dr. Arteaga:
 
Mrs. Olivier presented to the office today for a second opinion
regarding her current cardiac condition.  As her history is well
known to you, I will repeat it briefly for our records.  Mrs.
Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with a longstanding history of
coronary artery disease.  After several catheterizations in the
2060's which failed to document significant coronary artery disease
(done for evaluation of chest pain), angiogram in July of 2071
showed moderate circumflex coronary artery disease for which she
was managed medically.  However, she suffered a non-Q wave
myocardial infarction on February of 2072 at which time she
underwent cardiac catheterization now showing progressive coronary
artery disease and therefore underwent a multi-vessel coronary
bypass graft operation including a left internal mammary artery to
her LAD and reverse saphenous vein grafts to her PDA, D1 and obtuse
marginal branch.  She underwent repeat catheterization in February
of 2073 at the Comfrey Clinic which showed diffuse native disease
but apparently no significant bypass graft pathology.  She
underwent repeat cardiac catheterization in May of 2074 because of
a current angina and at this time she had evidence for a 60%
proximal LAD stenosis, a proximal severe circumflex artery stenosis
with no occlusion at the origin at a first obtuse marginal branch
and a 70% stenosis in the mid right coronary artery.  The saphenous
vein graft to the diagonal branch was patent with a significant
stenosis at its distal and astigmatic site, a saphenous vein graft
to the second obtuse marginal branch was patent as was the
saphenous vein graft to the posterolateral branch.  The left
intramammary artery to the LAD was a small vessel without discrete
stenoses.  Left ventriculogram demonstrated a moderate area of
posterior basal akinesis with a global ejection fraction of 60%. 
She therefore was transferred to the Midwest Eire Center
in early June where she underwent successful PTCA of her vein graft
to her diagonal artery.  She tolerated this uneventfully and was

discharged and since then has not had significant exertional chest
discomfort.  Her primary complaint is one of fatigue and mild
exertional dyspnea.  She has undergone extensive pulmonary
evaluation in the past including pulmonary function tests which
have revealed an FEV1 of 1.3 which is 59% predicted, and an FVC of
1.5 which is also 55% predicted giving her a pattern consistent
with restrictive rather than obstructive pulmonary disease.  In
addition, she has a history of a seizure disorder, diabetes,
hypertension and a nonspecific peripheral neuropathy.  
 
Medications at present:  NPH insulin 60 units sub q qAM, CZI
insulin 30 units sub q qAM, NPH insulin 60 units sub q qPM, enteric
coated aspirin one tab po q.d., atenolol 50 mg po b.i.d., Captopril
25 mg po t.i.d., amlodipine 5 mg po q.d., simvastatin 10 mg po
q.d., nitroglycerin prn, Nitropatch .2 mg for twelve hours of a
twenty-four hour period, Neurontin 300 mg one tab po t.i.d.,
Trusopt one drop ou q.d., Alantin one drop ou q.h.s. and albuterol
inhalers two puffs q.i.d. prn.
 
Cigarettes - none at present.  
 
Physical exam reveals a well-nourished mildly overweight woman in
no acute distress.  Blood pressure right arm sitting 140/70, heart
rate 75 and regular, respirations 12 and unlabored, weight 172
pounds.  The neck is supple.  JVP flat.  Carotids are 2+ without
significant bruits.  Chest is clear with a trace right basilar
rhonchi.  Cardiac exam shows a normal S1, physiologically split S2
and a I-II/VI systolic ejection murmur radiating from the apex to
the base, no significant diastolic murmur or rub.  The abdomen is
benign with bowel sounds well heard.  Extremities without
appreciable edema.  Peripheral pulses are intact.  There is 1+
bipedal edema. 
 
Electrocardiogram shows sinus rhythm at a rate of 75.  PR interval
of .14, QRS .08, QT .34, axis -20 degrees.  There is evidence of a
left atrial abnormality and poor R wave progression in leads V1
through V3.  
 
Impression:  Mrs. Olivier is a 62-year-old woman with significant 
atherosclerosis, diabetes and now a chief complaint of modest
exertional dyspnea and fatigue.  She denies any active chest
discomfort and apparently her recent angioplasty was successful at
alleviating the chest pain syndrome.  The records available to me
indicate that there is no continued efforts to diminish her beta
blocker therapy however in the past this had lead to an
exacerbation of her angina.  However, now that she is status post
her PTCA it is possible she now again will tolerate beta blocker
reduction and therefore, I suggested she decrease her atenolol to
50 mg po q.d.  She will have her blood pressure checked within the
next several days and assuming she remains asymptomatic, I will

also try diminishing her amlodipine in part because of peripheral
edema and in part because she may no longer need this.  Otherwise,
I have made no specific alterations to her medical regimen except
to encourage her to continue her aerobic activity level as best she
can and watch her saturated fat and cholesterol intake and stay in
close contact with you should her chest pain syndrome at all recur. 
I would be happy to assist in her management in any way you deem
appropriate.
 
Sincerely yours,
