Asked by Dr Dunn and Dr. Needham to comment on DM management in this 58 y/o man admited for amputation site debridement. He had fem-pop in 2080, and a R toe amp in 9/80. Howevere the site never healed, despite lack of clear infection. He is readmited on 3/28 for debridement. 



Narrative History

Type 2 DM diagnosed in  2078 - presented with urinary frequency and was not feeling well. He was admitted to the hospital for BG's of 400's and discharged on NPH insulin 30 units q am and 15 units q pm.  He has followed up with Dr. Dunn from our Diabetes department. He has not seen her since 3/80 but has kept up with her by phone. His home DM regimen consists of NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs. Last A1c was 6.1 3/80 and his BG's run ~ 100. 



He has hypoglycemia unawareness.

He has PVD s/p fem-fem bypass graft 6/30/80, ulcer on R big toe, (+)peripheral neuropathy.

Assessment

Type 2 DM complicated by PVD and neuropathy.  Well controlled on his home regimen. 

Recommendation

1.  Continue NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs.

2.  Suggest to change regular insulin sliding scale to humalog as this is more physiologic (acts faster and clears faster as well).  Give only half doses of this at hs since he will not be eating then.

3.  Please get a Hemoglobin A1c.  This will help us assess blood glucose control for the past 2-3 months and can help in discharge planning.

4.  He should folow-up with Dr. Dunn from Diabetes.





Thank you.
