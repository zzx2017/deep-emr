HPI:  The patient is a 43 year old man with multiple medical problems 
who presents for routine follow up.
 
CURRENT ISSUES:
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  The patient had a hemoglobin A1C 
     approximately a month and a half ago, which was 9.5.  We discussed 
     this in the office today, with the general concept that someone who 
     is taking three injections of insulin a day should have much 
     tighter control.  He states he has been following his finger 
     sticks, though admits that occasionally forgets to do this. His 
     current regimen is 35 units of NPH in the morning with 20 units of 
     regular.  At bedtime, he is taking 35 units of NPH and 6 units of 
     regular at dinnertime.  He denies any symptoms of hypoglycemia.
2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  Of note, the patient recently experienced a 
     rash to his simvastatin.  This resolved on the discontinuation of 
     the simvastatin.  Of note, his most recent cholesterol was 314 in 
     January, 2067.  He has met with the dietician to discuss the 
     institution of a low-fat diet, and states that he tries to avoid 
     fats.
3.   Venous insufficiency secondary to deep venous thrombosis.  The 
     patient states he is doing better since the institution of a 
     Jobst stocking.  He still notes significant edema when he doesn't 
     wear this, but notes an improvement in ambulation when he is 
     compliant with the stocking.
 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Blood pressure:  130/90.  Heart rate:  76.  
Respiratory rate:  12 and unlabored.  Cardiac exam:  Regular rate and 
rhythm, normal S1 and S2, no murmurs.  Lungs are clear to auscultation.  
Abdomen:  Soft, non-tender, obese, with active bowel sounds.  
Extremities show no clubbing or cyanosis.  There is 1+ pedal edema of 
the right lower extremity, which is covered with a Jobst stocking.  Foot 
care remains excellent.
 
IMPRESSION:                         
1.   Adult onset diabetes mellitus.  We will increase the patient's 
     morning NPH dose to 40 units.  He will once again try to become 
     more compliant with his diet.  He will be scheduled for a follow up 
     ophthalmologic examination.
2.   Hypercholesterolemia.  We will hold off re-starting therapy given 
     his recent rash to simvastin.  We will re-check a fasting lipid 
     profile as well as a set of LFT's.

3.   General health maintenance.  We will once again schedule a follow 
     up examination with the dietician as well as the ophthalmologist.  
     He will keep a log of his sugars and follow up with me in the 
     clinic in approximately one to two months.

Preceptor HINES,ALEXANDER SAMMY,M.D. Note:
Pt seen with Dr. Uecker.  Rash resolved off simvastatin.  Blood sugar and BP
sub-optimally controlled.  Agree with plan to increase BP meds and moniotr
FSGs more closely.  Fasting lipid profile prior to restarting statin.
