CHIEF COMPLAINT

Shortness of breath



HISTORY OF THE PRESENT ILLNESS

Mr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting to the ED with shortness of breath.  
Patient has had 2 prior admission (2121, 2122) for CHF exacerbations, last admission requiring lasix 80 IV TID to diurese 1-3L/day.  Patient states his dry weight is ~380lbs.  He was recently in Amboy after surgery for nonhealing venous stasis ulcer and returned home in 9/24.  Upon returning home his weight was down to 342 lbs, however upon admission it is 409 lbs.  Patients reports the past 3 weeks he has felt abdominal bloating, increased LE edema and increase dyspnea on exertion.  At baseline he is able to ambulate short distances on his cane however now he is barely able to get up off the toilet. 
He also reports increased drainage from his RLE wound.  He reports medication compliance except for missing 2-3 times over the past several weeks.  He reports increased fluid intake including Progresso soup, ice water, diet coke and a &#8216;dash&#8217; of salt to his food.  At baseline he requires 2L O2 during the day and 4L at night.  His CPAP machine has been broken for the past week.  He typically sleeps on 3 pillows but has recently increased to 4.  He awakes from sleep often feeling short of breath and sits on the edge of his bed to catch his breath.  Today he saw his PCP at Saint Mary's Hospital Fallbright Center for the above complaints and was sent immediately to the urgent care clinic.  From there he was transferred to the HBH ED.



In the ambulance he received 40 mg IV lasix x 1 and had 1L of UOP.  In the ED, VS were HR 106, BP 110/80  RR 20  O2 sat 96% on 5L.  He received another 40mg IV of lasix and put out 800 cc.  Labs revealed a K of 3.1, Mg of 1.4, Hct of 35.4 and BNP of 1625.  K and Mg were repleted.  Diltiazem 30mg po x 1 was given for rapid afib.  CXR showed stable interstitial edema.  Patient was admitted to medicine for further work up.

ASSESSMENT AND PLAN

Mr. Uribe is a 56 yo man with a history of CHF (EF 61%), COPD, OSA, PulmHTN, HTN, DMII, chronic venous stasis, and morbid obesity presenting with shortness of breath likely secondary to CHF exacerbation from right sided failure.  Appears to have class IV disease with symptoms at rest.  BNP is elevated from baseline (584) at 1625 confirming acute exacerbation.  Exacerbation may be from increased Na intake, medicine non-compliance and increased po fluid intake, could also be from anemia.



##: CHF exacerbation &#8211; patient responded well to 40mg IV lasix with UOP of 1 L


Lasix 40mg IV BID titrate to TBB goal of at least -1 L (will likely require more as patient required 80 mg IV TID last admission for CHF)
 
Monitor strict I/O&#8217;s
 
Daily weight (dry weight)
 
Na restrict to 2gm, fluid restrict to 2L/day
 
Continue lisinopril and verapamil for rate control
 
O2 therapy, titrate as indicated
 
If fails to improve with aggressive diuresis, consider PE CT given history of immobility



##: Anemia &#8211; iron studies last done in 2116.


Check Fe, TIBC, ferritin, retic count



##: Diabetes


Hold metformin
 
AC and HS finger sticks
 
Regular insulin sliding scale



##: Venous stasis ulcer


Continue BID ace wraps with calcium algenate and ABDs per vascular surgery
 
Patient has appt Thursday. w/Dr. Roe &#8211; will notify of admission



##: OSA


CPAP will inpatient; will attempt to assist patient obtaining working machine for at home



FEN: Low fat, low cholesterol, no concentrated sweets, 2gm sodium, 2L fluid diet



PROPHYLAXIS

GI: None

DVT: Heparin 5000 units TID (extreme obesity)

BOWEL: Colace, Senna prn
