Dear Dr. Stafford:
 
     I was asked to provide a cardiologic evaluation on Mrs.
Tinsley with a concentration on her appropriateness to be listed
as a recipient for a cadaver renal transplant.  In summary, she is
a 46 year old woman who has been an insulin dependent diabetic
since the age of 29 and has been on hemodialysis since 2083.  By
report, her other complications for diabetes include retinopathy,
peripheral neuropathy, and peripheral vascular disease.  In viewing
her present history, she works in the Houghton Mifflin Harcourt learning technology department.  Her
three times a week hemodialyses are uncomplicated.  She does,
however,  experience occasional chest pressure with activities and
on rare occasions has had nocturnal angina.  These episodes are
relieved by nitroglycerin.  Mrs. Tinsley has also noted that with
walking she will occasionally get short of breath which is relieved
by slowing down.  
 
     In addition to diabetes and hypertension which was present
only pre-dialysis, she has been and continues to be a smoker.  Her
cholesterol by one report was 228 mg/dl.  I don't have
fractionations and her family history is unknown.  
 
     A report of an echocardiogram from April of 2083, shows mild
ventricular hypertrophy in the presence of mitral insufficiency,
preserved LV size and function.  She had an exercise tolerance test
in February of 2085.  On a modified protocol, she went for less
than 4 1/2 minutes.  This is equivalent to not even completing
stage 1 of the standard Bruce.  With that, she did develop chest
pain and had 2 mm of ST depression. That study was accompanied by
both fixed and reversible isotopic perfusion changes in the septum
consistent with prior non-transmural infarct with exercise induced
ischemia.  As was apparent to those involved, even the non-isotope
portion alone was worrisome for high grade coronary disease and led
to the recommendation for a cardiac catheterization.  
 
     That study was done in Macdonald Hospital and at this time, I
only have the report.  However, from this report, there was
preserved LV function with anterior lateral hypokinesis and trace
MR that is consistent with the echo and the thallium studies. 
Coronary angiography showed by report, diffuse involvement of
proximal mid-LAD without specific focal stenosis until an 80% mid-
LAD.  The circumflex was also diffusely diseased and there was a
discrete stenosis in the mid section of a large marginal.  The
right coronary artery was diffusely diseased with a discrete
stenosis.  At that time, the recommendation was to continue medical
therapy.  
 
     Her medical therapy at this time is estrogen replacement with
prempro 2.5 mg once a day, tenormin 25 mg qd, aspirin one every
other day in addition to her supplemental vitamins, iron and twice
daily insulin therapy.  
 
     In rounding out her medical history, her surgical procedures
have involved the hemodialysis access.  She has had one pregnancy
28 years ago without complications.  I also elicited a history of
some focal arm weakness and occasional slurring of speech.  This
was difficult to pin down, but is of some concern.
 
     On exam, her blood pressure was 150/80  mm Hg, pulse 90
regular, her weight 95 lbs.  Her hemodialysis shunt is on the left
arm.  There was a right carotid bruit, neck veins were not
distended.  Lungs were clear, PMI was displaced and sustained. 
There was an S4, no S3 and there was a holo systolic murmur at the
apex.  Abdomen was benign, femoral pulses were intact, extremities
were without edema.  The electrocardiogram showed sinus rhythm,
diffuse STT changes.  There were no pathologic Q waves.
 
     Although the focus of this evaluation was originally for
transplant candidacy, I am concerned about her current cardiac
status.  She is a young diabetic woman, symptomatic of both
shortness of breath and chest pain and on exercise test, has
limited functional capacity.  The coronary angiography reveals a
presence of multi-vessel disease.  Even without seeing the primary
data which I hope to do in the next week, it would be unlikely that
she would be an angioplasty candidate, given the poor results in diabetics.  
Therefore, coronary revascularization for her would be coronary artery 
bypass surgery. 
 
 
     Obviously, I would like to review the films first, and speak
with Dr. Upson regarding augmentation of her anti-anginals.  I
would also like to add pravastatin at this time, starting with only
10 mg and obtain non-invasive studies of the carotids.  As
indicated, although the focus of this evaluation was her
suitability for transplantation, the issue of controlling
symptomatic coronary artery disease in this young woman became more
pressing.
 
     I look forward to working with you and the other physicians in
her care.
 
 
                                   Sincerely,
 
 
 
                                   Quentin U. Johnson, M.D., Ph.D.
