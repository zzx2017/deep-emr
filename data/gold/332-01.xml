Major Problems

Diabetes mellitus

Blood sugars have been good at home.  Hemoglobin A1c's have been good.  We are rechecking that again.

Hypertension

Blood pressure is okay today, 140/68.  We will need to follow this closely.  Her potassium has been up a little bit.  We will need to change around her medications to see if the Norvasc that we put her on increased her potassium.

Health maintenance

She continues to decline sigmoidoscopy and mammogram.  The patient's cyst at the left leg has been removed and is well healed at this time.



Physical examination

Blood pressure 140/68  

Weight   166 pounds

Neck   Thyroid exam is unremarkable

Nodes   No lymphadenopathy

Chest   Lungs are clear with no wheezes, rales, or rhonchi

Cor   No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  Carotids with normal upstroke without bruits

Extrem   Clear



Disposition

Return is to see me later in the spring.  Diabetes care is up-to-date.  She has her eyes checked and feet followed closely.  We will later discuss with her any further followup about the diabetes with Nutrition.
