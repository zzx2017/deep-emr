ID: Mrs. Bird comes in today for a routine check-up.  She is a 
70-year-old female with multiple medical problems including atrial 
fibrillation, status post renal allograft, status post MVR and AVR, on 
Coumadin now, history of CABG in the setting of her valve replacements, 
history of a recent aortic aneurysm repair with some mental status 
diminution after the surgery. 
 
MEDICATIONS: Synthroid, Hydralazine, Lopressor, prednisone, Coumadin, 
Provera, NPH insulin, Neurontin 300mg t.i.d., Imuran 100mg a day, Zocor 
20mg a day, and Digoxin 0.25 alternating with 0.125mg.  She is also 
taking Fosamax 10mg a day and Premarin 0.3mg a day.  
 
The patient is followed closely by a visiting nurse at home.  Her blood 
pressure checks have all been 120-140/70-90 and her blood sugars have 
been running in the morning between 80 and 120 and in the evening from 
150 all the way up to 450.  We have made some adjustments recently in 
her NPH morning dose, and hope to see if this will make a benefit.  
 
Patient notes that she has been feeling generally well, that she has 
been able to fill her cassettes for her medicines, and overall manage her 
medicines without problems.  She does note that she is having some pain 
down her left leg, which she describes as her usual sciatica.  The 
patient has had this on multiple occasions, and it usually waxes and 
wanes over time.  The Neurontin in the past has been very helpful for 
this. 
 
The patient denies any chest pain, shortness of breath, has had no 
fevers or weight loss recently, and has no dyspnea at nighttime. 
 
PHYSICAL EXAM: Notable for a short female in no acute distress, who 
walks with a walker today.  Blood pressure: 144/76.  Pulse: 78 and 
regular.  Her lungs bilaterally are clear to auscultation.   Her heart 
is with sharp click during S1 and S2.  She has got a regular rate and 
rhythm today.  Her abdomen is soft, nontender, with no organomegaly.  
She has got a well-healed abdominal scar. She has got no lower extremity 
edema.  Her musculoskeletal examination is notable for tenderness up 
into the sciatic notch on the left side.  She has got otherwise joints 
that move through a normal range of motion, no swelling or warmth. There 
is no evidence for ecchymoses or petechiae anywhere.  
 
Today will check a hemoglobin A1C, a CBC, and a chem 7 for routine 
monitoring. 
 
My overall impression is that Ms. Bird is doing quite well.   I will 
not make any changes to her medicines until I see her hemoglobin A1C.  I 
suggested that I could give her an injection for her sciatica, but I 
would rather wait because of her anticoagulation, and to see whether it 
remits on it's own.

Lastly, as far as her ability to drive, this has been an issue for the 
last several months since her abdominal aortic aneurysm repair. She is 
clearly doing better from a mental status standpoint, as evidenced by 
her being able to manage her own medications.  I have discussed this 
issue at length with family and her nurse, and everybody is comfortable 
with her trying to drive with someone in the car with her.  I will talk 
to her son, Steven Bird, who lives downstairs, and see whether he or 
his wife could help with trying her out driving first in a schoolyard 
without any people there, and then on less-crowded roads, and then 
finally in a more regular situation.  We will try this over time and see 
how it works, and I will be involved in making any decisions as far as 
letting her drive on her own.
