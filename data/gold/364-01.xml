CC/ID:  50yo man with DM and a 7-8 y h/o leg ulcers a/w venous stasis, p/w exacerbation of R calf ulcer.



HPI: This 50 yo man with DM and venous stasis has had chronic leg ulcers for 7-8 yrs.  The shallow ulcer on his right calf has been present for 5 months.  In the past 2 weeks, the patient has noticed increased pain and malodorous drainage from the site.  In the past he has been treated with antibiotics nad unaboots, but he cannot remember which antibiotics have been used in the past.  He denies fevers, chills, n/v/d/c, sweats, dysuria, weightloss or abd pain.

He also mentions that he has a red rash on his right forearm, across his abdomen, on the anterior chest, and in the groin.  Antifungal cream has been helpful for this in the past. 

Upon questioning, he reveals that he has had some mild left sided chest pain for 2 hours, which feels like a "pressure," non-radiating, and associated with shortness of breath.  He sleeps on 4 pillows (but that has been stable for 10 yrs), has occasional palpitations, no diaphoresis, no n/v.

U/A neg.



DIAGNOSTIC TESTS / CARDIOLOGY DATA:

No acute ischemic changes, no signif change from previous.  Pos. PVC.  Pos. PVC and bigeminy on telemetry.



RADIOLOGY:

Lower extremity dopplers neg. for DVT.

Plain films of lower extremities neg. for gas or osteal elevation.





IMPRESSION: 50 yo man with chronic venous stasis and exacerbation of RLE skin breakdown, left shift in WBCs, and chest pain with dysrhythmia.



PLAN:

1.	Cellulitis:  Despite DM and venous stasis, lesion that the patient has is very superficial, and therefore need not be treated as a diabetic ulcer, requiring coverage for pseudomonas and anaerobes.  This is rather a simple cellulitis, and may be treated with Ancef.  Consult wound care nurse to recommend appropriate dressings and care of wound.  Consider c/s surgery for unaboots.  No debridement necessary.  Send blood cx - monitor for bloodstream seeding.  Consider MRI of LE to r/o osteomyelitis, however, doubt such a shallow ulceration could cause it.

2.	Chest pain with bigeminy and PVCs:  Rule out for MI by enzymes x3, as ?new dysrhythmia may signify ?myocardial irritation/damage.  Monitor EKG and telemetry.  If ruled out, consider inpt vs. outpt adenoside mibi.  Check lipid panel to further elucidate CAD risk, possibly start a statin.

3.	Deconditioning/SOB:  Consult PT/OT to assist with mobility and exercise tolerance.  

4.	Prophylaxis:  Fragmin.  Counsel re: weight loss.
