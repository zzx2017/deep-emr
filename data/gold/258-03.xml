This patient of Dr. Bridges was seen because Dr. Bridges was
called away on an emergency basis.

His major concern is results of recent vascular studies.  He has
known diabetes and has a history of several years of exertional
cramping and discomfort in his legs.  This occurs only with heavy
exertion.  Dr. Bridges documented normal pedal pulses the last
visit.

His recent vascular studies showed no significant drop off and
perfusion pressures level of the ankle.

Did given his history a more inclined to suspect this might be
pseudoclaudication due to neuropathy or spinal stenosis.  He will
follow up with Dr. Bridges about next steps.

Ret he declines a flu shot today.
