EDVISIT^32707420^GIPSON, ALEC^07/25/60^YERGER, DESEAN

The patient was seen with Dr. Godfrey.  I confirmed her history

and physical.  I also interviewed and examined the patient. 

Please see the note for more details.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 71-year-old gentleman with

a history of hypertension, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and 2

weeks of intermittent chest pain for which he was evaluated with

stress test a week prior to ED visit, which was abnormal.  The

patient had a plan for cardiac catheterization the day after this

ED visit but presented on this day for an episode of chest

discomfort which occurred at rest, which was unlike his previous

episodes of chest discomfort which usually occurred with

activity.  He took nitroglycerin with relief and then presented

for further evaluation and treatment.

MEDICATIONS:  Metformin, Toprol, Cozaar, nitro, aspirin, and

Altace.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  He is awake and alert, in no distress,

chest pain free.  Afebrile with pulse 72, blood pressure 129/69,

and O2 saturation 98% on room air.  His lungs are clear to

auscultation.  Heart:  Regular rate and rhythm.  Abdomen is soft

and nontender.  Extremities are warm and well perfused.  No

elevated JVP.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  An EKG was done revealing right

bundle-branch block, but sinus rhythm at 67 with no ischemic

changes.  IV access was established.  Labs were sent revealing

essentially normal CBC and electrolytes.  Initial troponin was

less than assay with an INR of 1.1 and chest x-ray, which was

normal.  The patient has been taking aspirin prior to arrival. 

Heart rate was in the 60s in the emergency room and no additional

beta-blockade was given to the patient.  However, based on his

story, which was suggestive for unstable angina, he was given

Lovenox in the emergency room.  I spoke to the Cardiology B

attending on call who agreed to take the patient on to his

service for probable cardiac catheterization in the near future. 

With this plan, he was admitted in stable condition with a

diagnosis of unstable angina.

CRITICAL CARE TIME:  50 minutes.
