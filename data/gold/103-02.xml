This patient was seen by the resident.  I confirm that I have 

interviewed and examined the patient, reviewed the resident's 

documentation on the patient's chart, and discussed the evaluation, 

plan of care, and disposition with the patient. 

HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  The patient is a 52-year-old 

female status post LAD stent placement in November of 2067.  She 

presents to the emergency room with chest pain since last night.  

It has been midsternal going to her back.  She denies any knife or 

crushing pain going down her back.  However, the chest pain has 

been consistent since 9:00 to about 4:00 this morning.  No 

shortness of breath, diaphoresis, light-headedness, or dizziness.  

She did not take any nitroglycerin.  She presented to the emergency 

room today after she talked to her cardiologist, who wanted her to 

come to the emergency room for evaluation.  The patient denies 

taking any nitroglycerin and denies any chest pain episodes since 

her stent was placed back in November 2067.
