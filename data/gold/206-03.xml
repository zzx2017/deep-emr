Episodic Visit



He has had a cold for 5 days and wanted to get checked.  He says it started Saturday with a tickle in his throat; he went to the race track on Sunday and felt the same; on Tuesday he had dry cough, occasionally bringing up clear sputum.  He had no fevers but perhaps some mild sweats.  He notes mild sinus congestion and post-nasal drip.  No known sick contacts.  He got a flu shot at the TFMC in 11/74 and pneumovax at last appt in 11/74.  He is feeling mostly better, and was able to work out on the treadmill for 1.5 miles without difficulty.  He has had no chest pain or dyspnea.  He is using Robitussin DM, but askes if there is anything better for him to use.
