of care, and disposition with the patient.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  This is a 74-year-old woman with a

history of diabetes and hypertension who for the last 24 hours

really has had trouble getting out of bed.  She started feeling

felt like this before.  She does feel a little bit dizzy when she

stands up and went to North Iowa Oral Surgery Center where

they discovered her to be in heart block and sent her to us.

shortness of breath, and abdominal pain.  She does admit to

several bug bites.
