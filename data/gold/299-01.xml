VUONG,XOCHILT R   515-31-23-5                  VISIT DATE: 01/15/61
PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  Bleeding. 
HISTORY OF PRESENTING COMPLAINT:  This 71 year old female status 
post cardiac cath stent placement and then later EP study states 
that she was doing well until last night when she started to ooze 
from the groin site.  She did not apply any pressure.  She states 
that she was bleeding through the night, did not want to bother her 
brother, called Dr. Aponte today who told her to come in.  She 
states that she did not know where the site was.  She could not see 
it and she did not apply pressure.  She has no chest pain, no 
shortness of breath.  She is not dizzy.  She is on Lovenox and 
Coumadin both.  She has not had her PT checked.  The rest of the 
systems were reviewed and are negative. 
PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Depression, cardiac cath, hypothyroidism. 
MEDICATIONS:  Taken from the chart. 
ALLERGIES:  Taken from the chart. 
SOCIAL HISTORY:  She lives with her brother. 
PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  Her heart rate was 81, her temperature is 
96.5 degrees, blood pressure is 123/64.  This is a well-developed 
female, alert, oriented.  HEENT exam is atraumatic, normocephalic. 
Neck is soft and supple.  Mouth and throat are normal. 
Well-hydrated moist mucosa.  Conjunctiva are clear.  Sclerae are 
non-icteric.  There is no jugular venous distention.  Heart had a 
regular rate and rhythm.  The lungs were clear to auscultation 
bilaterally.  The abdomen was soft, nontender.  No guarding.  No 
hepatosplenomegaly.  There is a hematoma at the right groin.  The 
cath site was about 1 cm and closed but there was some small oozing 
from the site.  It stopped with pressure.  The patient was covered 
in blood and blood clots.  The old dressing was removed.  All the 
dried blood and blood clots were removed.  The patient was cleaned 
up by myself.  Then, the nurses put her in the hospital gown. 
LABORATORY EVALUATION:  PT, PTT, CBC were obtained. 
THERAPY RENDERED/COURSE IN ED:  After speaking with the patient at 
length, it seems that she lives with her older brother.  She is 
caring for him and is a bit overwhelmed with this.  Obviously, her 
medical knowledge base is not adequately prepared to deal with this 
problem.  She will be admitted to the Observation Area through the 
day for nurse training.  Social Services will be consulted to 
arrange for a home visiting nurse.  Dr. Aponte was called. 
CONSULTATIONS (including PCP):  Social Services and Dr. Aponte. 
FINAL DIAGNOSIS:  Bleeding from cath site and knowledge deficit. 
DISPOSITION (including condition upon discharge):  See the chart 
for disposition.
