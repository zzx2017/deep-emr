Plastic Surgery Consult Note


Chief PRS:  Dr. Anthony Giles
Senior PRS:  Dr. Dawn Julian
Junior resident: Dr. Oneida Norwood


Date: 3/21/2081


Patient Name:  Vieira, Nathan
MRN: 0666729



CC: 
Consult for radial artery harvest



HPI:  74 RHD M with coronary artery disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, Type II DM, peripheral arterial disease and prior cigarette abuse  admitted to the Vascular Surgery service on 3/8 with critical limb ischemia. On 03/09/2081, he underwent peroneal and popliteal angioplasty with thrombolysis of the femoral-popliteal bypass graft and stenting of the proximal anastomosis by Dr. Godfrey.  This was complicated by a postoperative MI. 03/15/2081, cardiac catheterization 
is significant for left main and multivessel coronary artery disease, and CABG was planned.  Of note, his cath was complicated by pseudoaneurysm of the right brachial artery at the point of access.   He was evaluated by SonoSite by the cardiac surgical PA, and was found to have no available venous conduit secondary to his multiple lower extremity procedures.  We are therefore consulted for radial artery harvest.

ALL:  Adhesive tape (Rash)
  
Physical Exam:
General:  
Alert, pleasant, NAD
RUE:  Palpable 2+ radial pulse, weakly dopplerable ulnar pulse.  Allen&#8217;s test: prior to compression of radial artery, SpO2 100%.  During compression, signal lost by probe within seconds.  Upon release, signal regained, SpO2 again 100%.   Localized edema of upper arm,  no obvious pulsatile mass.
LUE:  Well-healed scar anterior shoulder from prior surgery.  Palpable 2+ radial, 1+  ulnar pulses.  Allen&#8217;s test:  prior to compression of radial artery, SpO2 99%.  Remained 99% with compression of radial artery X2 minutes.  Clinical Allen&#8217;s test:  somewhat sluggish (5-6 seconds) pinking up of the exsanguinated hand upon release of the ulnar artery.

Assessment: 74 M with PVD and recent MI, preop for CABG sometime next week.  His left radial artery may be safe to use for conduit. His right is not usable. 


Recs:
-          Preop per Cardiac Surgery Service
-          Patient to be seen by Dr. Queen Olivares, Plastic Surgery Fellow.  She will not be available for radial artery harvest on Thursday of next week.




Discussed with Dr. Queen Olivares, Plastic Surgery Fellow.

Patient seen and examined. Addendum to above note on 3/22/81:
 
ROS: 
Denies HA, visual change
Denies CP, SOB, palpitations
Denies n/v, GI upset
Denies h/o seizures
Currently has LLE wound (from recent procedure)
States is R. handed, likes to golf, states hands are always cold and sometimes turn "blue"-no pain associatd w/ symptoms
Denies new onset of UE/LE weakness
 
Plan:
Allen's test on RUE is abnormal and is consistent with a dominant radial artery, however, left appears to be fine.
Will likely attempt harvest of LUE radial artery-will retest Allen's test intraop as welll
Please avoid any additional needle sticks or blood draws from the LUE
Please let the plastic team know ASAP of the surgery date so that our schedule can be coordinated with the CABG surgery
