Plan:



1)  Probable arthritis,  due to Hepatitis C- has seen Dr. Nixon as an outpatient for workup of her intermittent joint pain. Declined recommended EMG. Did not keep last appointment.   Consider Rheum input re: dx.



2) Paresthesias in feet- assume due to DM- already on Neurontin (and tegretol for psych issues).  Suggest consult by pharmacology.  Would like to broaden her pain control regimen to other modalities (non - narcotics, hydrotherapy, etc).



3)  DM- says FS at home have been <180 now on NPH bid.



4)  Psychosocial- benefits from limit setting and clear boundaries, ressurance. Anxiolytics and antidepressants. depression meds from outside mental health provider.



I expect her stay to be brief.  Dr. Bruce Koontz will cover the weekend 12/09/96 through 12/10/96.
