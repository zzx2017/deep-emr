Team 4 admission note


Admission Date/Time: June 26, 2152 at 7:30PM
Patient Name: Yasseen Jacks
MRN#: 8841350
Attending: Uriel Mays MD
Code status: DNR/DNI per discussion with son
Historian: medical record, patient's son Ursula Jacks


Chief Complaint: agitation


HPI: 
Mr. Jacks is an Indonesian-speaking 85M with a history of dementia, lung nodule, CHF who presents with progressively worsening agitation at home.  As patient is currently very somnolent this history is based on phone interview with Ursula Jacks who is the HCP and is very involved with his father's care.  The patient was diagnosed with dementia by his PCP about 3 years ago and has been relatively stable living at home (on 2nd floor) in Keystone Heights with his wife who has been his primary caretaker; their two sons are very involved as well.  Over the last 6 months they have noticed increasing confusion, agitation, and labile emotions.  They noted he has been confused about location, time (recalls distant past but not recent past), and has occasionally not been able to identify his wife.  He has become emotionally labile and sometimes agitated.  His son notes that he recently had to physically force him to sit down and take his medications.  His wife has had to stay up at night to watch the patient to make sure he did not wander.  They are particularly worried about his ability to take the flight of stairs to their home since it takes him about 15 min to get up and appears unsteady. About 1 wk ago, while his wife was out of their home, he wandered out and locked himself out; when she returned he angrily accused her of locking him out.  Their mother has had increasing difficulty caring for him and has called the 2 sons for help daily for the past week.  They called his PCP about these accelerating changes and he was started on lorazepam 0.5-1mg Q4h prn which brought mild improvement.  Out of concern for his father's and mother's safety they brought him to the ED for evaluation and placement which their PCP has already begun to discuss with them.


They have not noticed fever/chills, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea/constipation (on aggressive regimen), complaints of pain, vision changes.  They have noticed recent urinary incontinence in the last few days.  


In the ED:  VS were T: 98.2    P: 71    BP: 169/84    RR: 18    SaO2: 93% RA.  Exam was notable only for rales bilaterally and mild-moderate agitation. CXR was normal. CBC was at baseline.  UA pending. CT brain could not be performed due to agitation.  They spoke to his PCP who felt this was all due to progression of his dementia.  He was given ativan 2mg IV (total) and haldol 5mg IV (total).  Also got labetalol PO 200mg PO x 1.  




Past Medical History: 


Diabetes mellitus (adult onset): diet-controlled. 

Hyperlipidemia

Thyroid nodule: stable for years, on methimazole

Anemia

Benign essential hypertension

Congestive heart failure

Dementia

Lung Nodule: increase in size of lung nodule when CT repeated in Feb (suspicious for BAC) Son Ursula spoke to Dr. Daniel (per son's report) and they discussed observing and not being aggressive with surgery etc as even though it could be cancer, an invasive operation, considering his multiple other problems, could be much worse for him than simple observation. They have an appt with Dr. Daniel in September.
