This is my first visit with Teresa Hardy (MR#36052413), a 54 yo F here to
meet her new PCP. She has not seen a doctor in many years.  She made this appt,
because she had heavy vaginal bleeding 2 weeks ago.  She normally has her
periods q28d, with 5 days of heavy flow.  Her last period lasted for 15 days
with the usual clots and heavy flow.  The bleeding stopped 2 weeks ago, and
there is no spotting now.  She denies any abd pain.  She denies possiblity of
pregnancy, although she has unprotected intercourse with a longtime partner.

Impression:  54 yo perimenopausal woman.
Plan:
1.  GYN - prolonged menstrual cycle likely from perimenopausal state.  Since
this was her first episode of prolonged bleeding, will not pursue further w/u
at this point.  Pt given reassurance, and asked to continue to record the dates
and duration of her menses.  Pt denied h/o fibroids or FHx of GYN cancer. 
 
2.  CV - pt reports h/o BP's of 160/80 in the past.  She was 162/100 today.
She was very reluctant to initiate any BP medicine (I suggested atenolol 25 mg
po QAM), and want to try diet and exercise first.  She understands the health
risks of HTN and knows that it is very common among African Americans.  Will
follow this issue closely and readdress at next visit.
 
3.  Health maintenance - await PAP results.  Will check CBC, SMA7 and lipid
panel today.  Will schedule screening mammogram at next visit.
 
4.  f/u with me in 1 month.
