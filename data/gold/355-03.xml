Urine Cx, Blood Cx, Sputum Cx pending



EKG, 10/31: sinus tachycardia, inferior Q waves in II and III, poor R wave progression, Right axis deviation 

CXR, 10/31: There is patchy density at the left base projecting posteriorly on the lateral image consistent with pneumonia.  There is no evidence of pneumothorax or pleural effusion. Left lower lobe pneumonia



Impression/Plan: 



58 yo male w/ tardive dyskinesia, reactive airway disease, h/o PML, h/o Pulmonary embolus who p/w wheezing and hypoxia

1.	Presentation of wheezing and hypoxia consistent w/ community acquired PNA especially given evidence of left lower lobe infiltrate on Chest X Ray and bandemia.  Less likely that Pt had a Pulmonary embolus since he is therapeutic on coumadin with an INR of 3.0 today, no evidence of RVH on EKG, no chest pain on presentation.  Will treat with ceftriaxone and azithromycin.  Will support with albuterol inhaler treatment prn SOB.  Will also continue Pt's outpatient reactive airway disease medication regimen of advair 

2.	h/o PE on Coumadin, INR 3.0 today, will hold Coumadin for tonight since starting Antibiotics.  Will carefully monitor INR.

3.	Tardive dyskinesia: stable, continue outpatient medication regimen

4.	Diabetes Mellitus: will hold Pt's oral hypoglycemic medication while in hospital, will cover w/ ISS

5.	Hypertension: will continue Lisinopril

6.	FEN: Will encourage PO intake as tolerated.  Pt w/ increased Cr likely secondary to slight dehydration.  Will follow closely along w/ electrolyte panel.  Will adjust electrolytes accordingly.  Will start Pt on a diet w/ low saturated fat and low cholesterol.
