HPI: Patient is a 75 y/o M, a former smoker, with Hx of multiple medical problems including macular degeneration in the R eye, CAD, NIDDM, HTN and hypercholesterolemia.  A month ago he first noticed what he describes as &#8220;blue floaties&#8221; in the LLQ of his L eye&#8217;s visual field.  He then saw his ophthalmologist at the Shenandoah Hospital in Parchman who concluded that this is not due to macular degeneration.  He denies having headaches or any other symptoms at that time.  He denies similar episodes of &#8220;floaties&#8221; in the past and he has no Hx of headaches, disarthria, motor deficits, sensory loss and has never been hospitalized with a stroke or TIA.  He recalls having &#8220;high kidney function&#8221; in the past, but does not recall details.  His PCP arranged for an U/S evaluation, which was done on 8/05/81 and showed 80-85% stenosis of the L proximal ICA.  Patient has had surgeries in the past and had no adverse effects to anesthesia administration.  He considers himself fit and in good shape.

Patient seen and examined. Agree with above student note. In brief, 75yM with PMH significant for DM, HTN, high cholesterol, and macular degeneration who presents with recent onset of intermittent, transient &#8216;blotches&#8217; in left eye. Carotid US evaluation showed left sided velocities consistent with 80-85% stenosis of left proximal ICA. He is admitted pre op for operating room tomorrow. Home meds with exception of oral antihyperglycemics will be resumed. See detailed plan above.



Discussed w/ Arthur Tisdale, chief resident, who agrees w/ assessment and plan.
