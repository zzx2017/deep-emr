EDVISIT^92819461^STEPHENSON, BREDNA^07/15/86^WALLACE, VELMA

I saw this patient on 07/15/2086 in conjunction with Dr. Echols. 

I confirm that I have interviewed and examined the patient,

reviewed the resident's documentation on the patient's chart, and

discussed the evaluation, plan of care, and disposition with the

patient.

CHIEF COMPLAINT:  A 68-year-old female with leg pain.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  The patient with known coronary

artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and diabetes, status

post left fem-pop bypass and transmetatarsal amputation of her

left foot at the Siouxland on 05/02/2086.  This was complicated by

acute renal failure with creatinine between 1.6 and 2.4 and

labile sugars.  She was discharged to rehab on 04/19/2086 for

approximately 1 month.  Subsequently, she developed left thigh

erythema, swelling, and pain along the incision site yesterday. 

She has had no fevers, nausea, or vomiting but has had difficulty

ambulating due to pain, denies any diarrhea but has had some mild

stomach upset.

PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Remarkable as I said for hypertension,

diabetes, CHF, chronic renal insufficiency, peripheral vascular

disease, and hypothyroidism.  She had MIBI in 2084 with LAD and

D1 lesion.  Her EF was 35%.  She had a CABG in 2083.

Social history, family history, and review of systems are as per

the written note.

MEDICATIONS:  Amitriptyline, atenolol, aspirin,

hydrochlorothiazide, insulin, Lasix, lisinopril, Norvasc,

Synthroid, Zocor, and Zoloft.

ALLERGIES:  None.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  The patient is awake and alert, in no

acute distress, however, distinctly uncomfortable.  Vital signs: 

Temperature is 97.2, pulse 59, respiratory rate 20, blood

pressure 148/67, and oxygen saturation is 97% on room air.  For

full physical exam findings, please see the resident's written

note.  Specifically, HEENT, neck, abdominal exam, and neurologic

exams are within normal limits as documented.  Respiratory exam

reveals crackles at the bases but no respiratory distress. 

Cardiovascular exam:  Regular rate and rhythm with 2/6 systolic

ejection murmur at the left upper sternal border. 

Musculoskeletal exam:  The fem-pop incision on the left leg is

concerning for purulent drainage along the incision site,

especially along the upper aspect of the upper thigh.  There is

approximately an area of 8 x 5 cm of erythema, induration, and

tenderness surrounding the area draining purulent material.  The

patient also has a transmetatarsal amputation.  The wound there

is clean, dry, and intact.

LABORATORY DATA:  CBC and electrolytes remarkable for white blood

count of 10.9, BUN and creatinine ratio of 30:1.4 respectively.

EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT COURSE:  Surgery was consulted regarding

this likely wound infection.  Vancomycin, levofloxacin, and

Flagyl were their request for antibiotics.  These were

administered in the Emergency Department, and the patient will be

admitted for likely operative debridement of this wound

infection.

 ******** Not reviewed by Attending Physician ********

PRIMARY DIAGNOSIS:  Postsurgical infection.

SECONDARY DIAGNOSIS:  Diabetes.

TERTIARY DIAGNOSIS:  Peripheral vascular disease.

DISPOSITION:  Admitted.
