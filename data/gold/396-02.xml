First visit in over 5 months. Had injury at work, fell and rx right shoulder- had surgery and now will have to have shoulder replacement by Dr. Denny.  Went through rehab and has been living with her son in Washington- her apartment is being fixed up but likely she will move because of issues with elevator- lookiing for elderly housing.  No pain issues, still has constipation- takes senna and colace bid.  Is concerned about addictive personality- off narcotics but is attending NA meetings and wants to get of amitriptyline and  trazodone-would like to try neurontin.

BS are good- on 18 units insulin bid and has been trying to lose wt- 1+ /week.

Will have EMG on 11/26  because of numbness right hand and concern about brachial nerve. Will also have CT.  She has tingling left medial fingers - advised EMG of that hand too.   Needs BMD- needs to get clearance from workers comp.
