EDVISIT^43471375^KIMBROUGH, AMELIA^05/29/59^STEELE, SHAYLYN

This patient was seen with resident, Dr. Elmore.  Resident's

note was reviewed.  The patient was seen and examined by me, and

I confirm the resident's findings.

HISTORY OF PRESENT ILLNESS:  In brief, Ms. Kimbrough is a

46-year-old woman with history of hypothyroidism, anxiety,

diabetes, and nephrotic syndrome.  She is also dialysis

dependent.  Her last dialysis was yesterday, she developed acute

onset chest pressure with severe shortness of breath and

diaphoresis while at home.  Called EMS and was brought to the

Emergency Department.  The patient is unable to give a full

history and at this time secondary to her significant respiratory

distress.  Please review resident's note for full details of

obtainable past medical history, social history, review of

systems, medications, and allergies.

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION:  I confirm the physical exam is as

documented.  The patient is awake in severe respiratory distress.

 Pulse is 126, respirations 40, blood pressure is initially noted

at 253/129, and oximetry is 92% on facemask.  Physical exam

reveals a diaphoretic woman who is breathing rapidly with

accessory muscle use, nasal flaring and tripoding.  She has rales

halfway up bilaterally with inspiratory and expiratory wheezes. 

Cardiac exam reveals tachycardia.  Abdomen is obese but soft. 

Extremity exam reveals bilateral 3+ edema up to the knees. 

Rectal exam reveals trace heme-positive stool that is brown.

On route, the patient received multiple doses of sublingual

nitroglycerin as well as IV Lasix.  She is known to make urine, a

Foley catheter was placed immediately.  IV access was

established, and the patient received large doses of diuretics. 

Was immediately started on IV nitroglycerin and a BiPAP.  On

BiPAP, the patient's oxygenation was 100%.

LABORATORY DATA:  Labs were obtained, which showed a hematocrit

of 36, and BUN and creatinine of 15 and 5.1.  BNP was noted at

700.  Cardiac enzymes:  CK was 334, CK-MB 4.9, and troponin was

less than assay.  However, labs were obtained within half an hour

of her symptoms starting, magnesium was low at 1.6.  Urinalysis

was negative and urine HCG was negative.  EKG was sinus

tachycardia without any ST or T-wave changes concerning for

rate-related ischemia.  There were no prior EKGs available. 

Chest x-ray showed bilateral CHF.  The Nephrology fellow covering

hemodialysis was notified that the patient would need immediate

hemodialysis and this was scheduled for 6:00 a.m.

DIAGNOSIS:  End-stage renal disease, hemodialysis dependent, and

CHF.

ASSESSMENT:  Given the patient's constellation of symptoms, it is

likely that she had an ischemic event that caused flash pulmonary

edema and subsequent symptomatology.  Given the current regimen,

in the Emergency Department, the patient gradually improved.  The

respiratory rate was noted at 23.  Her heart rate came down to

113 and blood pressure was well controlled on the IV

nitroglycerin noted finally at 140/77.  The patient was taken to

hemodialysis at 7:45 and admitted to the hospital thereafter for
