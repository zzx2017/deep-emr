Ms. Quijano is a 61 yo morbidly obese woman with CAD, OA, and CHF who is in for follow-up of these problems.  



History of Present Illness	

She is working every day and feels much better than she did last year.  She has had multiple admissions in the past for CHF and for ischemia.  Recent echo shows septal and apical hypokinesis.  



She has had no chest pain.  She does not complain of SOB.  She does cough, but this is because of the air conditioning and postnasal drip, she believes.  



She also complains of severe knee pain, with the right worse than the left.  She can walk a little, but standing is very painful.  



In addition, she complains of some food intolerance.  She has a hard time eating breakfast because she gets abdominal cramps.  After eating orange juice, she gets terrible cramping and has to run to the bathroom to have a bowel movement.  She has changed her milk to lactaid, which she says helps.  Certain types of salad dressing also cause this reaction.
