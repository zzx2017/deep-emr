Assessment

Type 2 DM complicated by PVD and neuropathy.  He was not eating well 7/01-7/02 but says his appetite has now recovered.



Recommendation

1.  Continue NPH insulin 25 units q am and 10 units q hs.

2.  Suggest to change regular insulin sliding scale to humalog as this is more physiologic (acts faster and clears faster as well).  Give only half doses of this at hs since he will not be eating then.

3.  Please get a Hemoglobin A1c.  This will help us assess blood glucose control for the past 2-3 months and can help in discharge planning.

4.  He should folow-up with Dr. Dunn from Diabetes.





Thank you.
