FREEPORT MEMORIAL HOSPITAL



History of present illness   Ms Rivers was hospitalized 1/22-1/24/67 after presenting to ER with left shoulder pain that evolved to an ache radiating to her chest and forearm, associated with nausea, diaphoresis, dizziness.  In the ER, the pain was characterized as mechanical, but was also relieved by SLNTG (which however precipitated hypotension, brady to 30s). EKG showed only ? slight exaggeration of baseline 1mm ST elevation in V2, V3.  She was heparinized and admitted to SDU.  R/O by serial markers.  Cardiac cath on the day after admission showed a tight RCA (with unclear relationship to anterior ischemia seen on prior stress). She is now s/p Cypher stent, with plans for at least three months of Plavix.

Major Problems

Diabetes mellitus

A:

- Per patient, history of type I diabetes - Followed at the Hometown Medical Center, Dr. Abernathy (beginning 4/2066) - On Lantus and a humalog sliding scale (checks her blood sugars at home QID) - Has a podiatrist and an opthalmologist and is followed regularly.  Has dilated eye exam scheduled for 2/67 

- last Hgb A1C 9/66 still elevated 9.70 - last urine microalbumin screen 10/66 negative 

A: - 1/21/67: Pt reports that her AM sugars have been running high.  Her Lantus has been increased by the HMC staff from 9 U to 12 U to 14 U (as of several days ago) 

- 1/23/67 HgbA1c 11.3

P: -1/21/67: q3 month HgbA1c while not meeting treatment goals; remains on Lantus 14 U qHS

- 1/23/67: Pt has f/u appointment at HMC on 1/27.  Will also offer referral to FMH diabetes center for consolidated f/u.

Hypertension

A:

- 7/11/66: Hypertensive on atenolol 25 qd and lisinopril 20 qd when seen by Dr. Olszewski. He recommended the Omron HEM 711 model for home bp monitoring. Has kept a log of blood pressures, and based on the data, her lisinopril was increased to 40 mg qd and HCTZ 12.5 mg qd was added by Dr. Olszewski. - 8/21/66: Most recent measurements showed typical bp's 130-150/70s, HR 60s-70s. 160/90 in office. Didn't want to increase HCTZ until d/w cardiologist - 9/05: electrolytes wnl on HCTZ; HCTZ increased by Dr. Olszewski - 10/17/66: HCTZ d/c'd, amlodipine started at 5 mg given exacerbation of hypercalcemia - 12/12/67: Remained hypertensive.  D/w Dr. Olszewski and increased amlodipine to 10 mg QD - 1/21/67: BP 130/80 with HR 60 today.  Per Dr. Olszewski clinic note from 1/07/67, SBPs at home 129-135 with HR 60s 

- 1/23/67: No significant RAS seen on abdominal aortogram

P: -1/21/67: c/w current regimen: lisinopril 40, norvasc 10, atenolol 25

- 1/24/67: Pt was instructed to schedule post discharge bp check in office

Coronary artery disease

A:

- Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, HTN, remote tobacco, postmenopausal - Adenosine-MIBI 6/08/2066:    ECG response to pharmacological stress was  positive for ischemia. The perfusion images are suggestive of a small area of mild anterior ischemia. - TTE 6/2066: dilated LA, mild to moderate MR, borderline symmetric LVH, no SWMA, EF 71%, moderate TR, RVSP 42 mmHg    -1/21/67: No chest pain or SOB 

- Admitted with left shoulder pain 1/22/67. R/o by markers.  Cath 1/23 showed calcified subtotally occluded RCA which was PCI'd with a CYPHER stent (the vessel was on the smaller side and was co-dominant) as well as OM2 and OM3 disease not intervened on because small territory.  

P: 

- 1/23/67:  Plavix x 3 months added to current regimen of ASA, lipitor, atenolol, lisinopril, amlodipine.  Patient also enrolled in HIT Cath study and will need repeat HIT antibody and platelet draw on d3 and d7 post cath.



Other Problems

He reports that results of her event monitor revealed no arrhythmias.  He concurs that her episodes sound like they may be related to vagal episodes. 

- 1/05/67:  f/u brain MRI and EEG scheduled by neuro 

- 1/24/67:  Called patient and reviewed that she will need to reschedule her MRI given her new stent (~8 weeks)
