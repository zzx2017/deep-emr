Assessment and Plan



Chest pressure and dyspnea. The patient has known coronary vasospastic events for which she has consulted with cardiology. The symptoms that she describes suggest possible symptomatic cardiac ischemia. She had a baseline ECG today in my office that was normal. I have instructed the patient to follow up with cardiology for further assessment and an ETT. I will communicate with Dr. Wright. The description of symptoms do not suggest unstable angina. 
Glucose intolerance with post prandial hyperglycemia. Continue metformin, well tolerated, HbA1c requested. 
Hyperlipidemia. On atorvastatin. Target LDL &lt;70, new values requested. 
Hypertension. Stable, continue current medications. 
Microscopic hematuria with negative work up. Surveillance UA and cytology requested. 
Rhinopharyngitis. Amoxicillin and fluticasone initiated. 
Gynecology contact information provided. 
Ophthalmology contact information provided. 
Bone densitometry requested. 
Labs requested. 
Follow up after tests or in 3-6 months.
