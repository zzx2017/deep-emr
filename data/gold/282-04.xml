Dear Dr. Craft,

 

I had the pleasure of seeing Peter Joshi in the Cardiovascular Division on Tuesday.  This lovely gentleman with coronary artery

disease requiring previous stenting and mild systolic dysfunction

notes that he had to participate in the resuscitation of his son,

who remains in the Beechwood ICU last night.  Despite this

intense stress, he has no clear dyspnea on exertion,

palpitations, lightheadedness, or chest discomfort at the present

time.  He continues on aspirin, Lasix 60 mg a day, Isordil 40 mg

p.o. t.i.d., Zestril 40 mg a day, Lopressor 100 mg b.i.d.,

simvastatin 20 mg a day, Norvasc 5 mg p.o. b.i.d., Prevacid,

multivitamins, and K-Dur in addition to his insulin.

 

On physical exam today, his blood pressure is 180/75.  His heart

rate is 54 and regular.  Respiratory rate is 10.  There is no

increase in jugular venous pressure.  Carotids are without

bruits.  Lungs are clear to auscultation throughout. 

Cardiovascular exam is notable for lateral PMI, S4, S1, and

physiologically split S2.  His abdomen is soft and nontender.  He

has no bruits.  His extremities are warm with strong symmetric

pulses and motor strength throughout.  He has no peripheral edema

at the present time.  His electrocardiogram is notable for sinus

bradycardia, evidence of prior inferior myocardial infarction,

and lateral downsloping S-T, which are unchanged from his prior

electrocardiograms.

 

Mr. Joshi presents today with a euvolemic volume status, but a

concerning blood pressure.  At this point, he notes that he is

actually taking his Isordil b.i.d., and I will let him continue

to do that.  We will increase his Norvasc to 10 mg, and he will

be following up with you within the next few weeks.  If there are

any other thoughts in the care of this gentleman, please give me

a call.

 

Sincerely,

 

Dictated By: Corrine James-Wagner
